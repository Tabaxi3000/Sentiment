"  Tokyo Narita to Singapore. I have flown ANA several times on both economy and premium economy cabin and it is a seemless ride, wonderful service from both ground and inflight crews.  You really get the feeling that ANA staff care about their clients. Food is delicious, great quality of wines, IFE with plenty of choices. The 2x4x3 configuration is the best layout I ever saw on a Boeing 777. Only downside is how the Y seat reclines, instead of your back reclining, it is your hips that slide forwards hence reducing your leg room. Hard to describe but the economy seat isn't reclining the traditional way thus making it a biy uncomfortable, and I decided not to recline. The premium economy seats recline well. Besides that ANA is a well deserved 5-Star airline.",1
"  Despite the age of the plane, the refreshed economy interior was a big upgrade despite its 10 abreast layout. For someone that is relatively compact, the seat felt perfect and the usable seat width doesn't feel too bad. The only complaint is the unresponsive IFE screen. The seat phone tray is genius and the folded tray table is the best. The cabin crew were were able to move meals around the trolleys between cabins and all options were available. The only issue with the IFE is that the touch screen technology is old and the screen was sometimes completely unresponsive or hanged and you had to be patient for it to reload. On my return flight, it seemed to be slightly better.",1
"  Munich to Istanbul.  The plane took off almost 40 minutes late; no explanation, no apology. The cabin was clean and modern, legroom bearable, seat pitch uncomfortable, plane fully booked, cabin overheated. We had tried to stay within limitations for hand luggage but found out that nobody else bothered. Cabin staff stressed and unsmiling, delivering uncoordinated service, running back and forth with the trolleys, standing in each other´s way,  and forgetful if you ordered anything extra. Cabin announcements erratic language-wise, sometimes in Turkish, English, German, sometimes in Turkish, English; English announcements hard to understand. Personal IFE didn't provide 3D-maps. Food quite eatable but served lukewarm. After landing at Ataturk airport (breathtaking views of the city during approach!), erratic announcements that didn´t bother to mention the local time. Ataturk airport is a surprise in that it is overcrowded but still manages to operate immigration and customs quite swiftly (Munich take note!). I usually enjoy flying but this was the first time I couldn't wait to get off a plane. ",0
" Hong Kong to Paris via Dubai with Emirates. Had great 6 days stopover in Dubai. Value for money! The best entertainment system on board for sure. Loved their live TV, but unfortunately it is not available on all flights. Meals are just okay, service is slow and disorganized. They take out blankets and headsets from the people 40 minutes before landing, while people moving to the toilets up and down aisles and it creates such a mess in the cabin. ",1
" Gold member on EK but decided to fly with Cathay from Singapore to Vancouver via Hong Kong and back. Influenced by the pricing strategy of the airline which is to entice passengers from countries in the Far East to travel to YVR with Cathay. Very much regret the choice. Noted a big deficiency in the airline’s punctuality and the casualness of ground staff. Not an airline to use if the connecting time is short. Outbound flight from SIN to HKG was delayed, meaning that the 2+ hours connecting time vanished. All connecting passengers (about 10 of us) had to literally sprint in HKIA to catch the YVR flight. On the inbound flight from YVR to HKG, an initial delay of 1 hour was announced. Despite the fact that connecting time in HKG was only 1 hour 15 minutes, the ground staff gave full assurance that the plane would make up for the lost time. Alas, with a delay of more than 2 hours to depart from YVR, the connecting flight HKG-SIN was missed. After a gruelling 12 hour flight from YVR plus the delay of 2 hours, I had to wait for another 5 hours in HKG to catch the next flight to SIN. As a souvenir, a meal voucher was offered!",0
"  My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit, but to sleep it is not comfortable at all: too hard, too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient, sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again. ",0
" Would probably never recommend this airline to anyone. While their staff are nice and did tried to accommodate us, it made absolutely no sense that we are put on two separate seats again. Twice! First time, they were able to change our seats and this time they just say ""sorry it's full"". We even checked in 23 hours ahead and were unable to grab any seats together. Upsetting to have to sit next to random people.",0
"  New business class Suite III is inferior to the Suite II - the area where your feet / legs go tapers off. So if you are a tall person you are going to struggle to bend to the space. When the seat is not in full decline there is no support under your legs - from the seat to the feet area. This means you are going to be constantly trying to find a comfortable position if working / eating or not in full decline. - when you are partially reclined and have the table down it is quite small. The Suite II seat was superior (especially the window seat) on privacy and just in regards to the actual seat. No issues with the recline position/support or table. The flight attendants aren't trained to look at the list of who is a frequent flyer with their own airline. I am a Diamond flyer (the top frequent flyer status) and still watch in amusement that my Japanese wife gets a 'thank you for joining us again today. Thank you for on-going support'. In the meantime, me, a non-Japanese person, get no acknowledgement at all! (I have only been acknowledged about my status less than five times in all). This time - I got... 'You want the Japanese menu of course - that is why you chose to fly with a Japanese airline right? Is it your first time to Japan?' Ask your cabin crew to check the passenger list of non-Japanese travellers. If they are a JAL frequent flyer - then acknowledge them like you do with the Japanese. On arrival into Japan my flight was late (due to the flight arriving in Sydney late) due to the aircraft having trouble in Japan. I was not assisted to get to the next flight to Osaka even though the later flight had over an hour to go until departure I got that flight is already boarded - a domestic flight boarding an hour before departure? Instead, I was put on the Kansai Osaka flight and arrived at 2am in the morning instead of 8.30pm. Ground crew didn't even try and didn't have a 'can do - let's fix our mistake attitude'. Food out of Japan is good. Out of Sydney, it is not good! The quality is lacking. I recommend the western dish out of Sydney and then the Japanese dish out of Japan. Inflight entertainment  is an old system and the choice is OK for a couple of flights. You will struggle to find choice if going on more than a couple of flights a month.  The technology on the handset is very 2000s. The screen in business and economy are good. WIFI drops in and out - but it is normal on all airlines. Good enough to work and get things done. ",0
"  Had a great flight from Paris to San Fransisco. Had a ""hop"" flight and connected through Paris. Boarding was not that quick though. Had to wait a few minutes in the airbridge which was kind of hot. Seat room was good, a bit larger than KLM and Delta on long haul flights. Cabin staff came by almost every hour with drinks. Food was the best I have had on economy during a flight, time went by really fast for my opinion. I would fly with AF again!",1
"   Check-in was a bit confusing (airport is going through some big renovations, I guess not AF fault). Boarding was on-time but the plane had to wait for ""something"" on tarmac for almost an hour. Pilot made bilingual announcements regarding the delay though the English-version was incomprehensible. He even made mistake regarding the destination we are flying to (Paris Orly rather than Paris CDG, though crew rectify the mistake). Crew was very polite and smiley (as always with AF). Once airborne, we were served drinks and coffee with a small cookie. It was perfectly adequate for such a short flight. We landed 45 minutes late. ",1
"  When is extra leg room, extra leg room. 11 of us travelled on Emirates from Bham to Dubai/Sydney 28 October 23 and returned 16 Nov back into Bham EK0039 flight. We paid for extra leg room seats 80J K H so that we could relax and have sleep on the long journeys ahead of us. On 3 of the trips the air stewards were respectful of our space, given we were next to where they served the food and drinks with their trolleys. They were all quiet during the long flights once drinks and food had been served so myself, husband and son could sleep. However, on the flight from Dubai to Bham this could not be a worse experience if Emirates tried. The team were inexperienced (bar one professional) one of them swearing so we could hear F""** word as the curtains were left open, explaining what she required in men. The food and drinks trolley was left next to my husband within an inch of his feet so they stepped over him each time, apologising for waking him up over the next 3 hours. A team of 6 stood in our area having a meeting. After 4 hours into the 8 hr flight, I politely asked if they could move the trolley so we were not disturbed and it was really disrespectful given we had paid extra for the seat. The deputy and mgr came to see us to apologise and talk to their team and moved the trolley. I showed the mgr a picture. The mgr took my phone and email details to formally respond, but 9 days later still no response. Very disappointing, given 11 of us travelled. The previous 3 flights were really good.",0
"  Toronto to Istanbul. Check in and boarding were smooth. Onboard, the aircraft interior looked worn, the air was stale and sticky. The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapés, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule. Overall it was a decent experience but the decline in catering quality was very obvious.",1
"  Toronto to Chennai via Doha. It is troubled times with COVID-19 and India was under lockdown. Had to reschedule tickets a couple of times due to restrictions and restricted airspace. Qatar Airways Contact Centre Rep was so very patient, most helpful, empathetic and understood the pressure of the situation and provided multiple options. We don’t see that many people in our day to day life. Thank you.",1
"  This was the 2nd leg of our journey from Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City with Emirates, the first having been on a A380. We arrived in the morning local time and left in the morning local time. The food on the first leg was ok - not brilliant, but not awful just average. When we got on the next flight we were served a seafood lunch, at 9 am (ish) local time or 6 am as per our body clocks. Needless to say it remained untouched. Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future. Having said all of that it was relatively cheap for Business class so I guess in this instance you sort of get what you pay for. (Best food to date was on ANA, best seats on Qantas A380)",0
"  The most unreliable I've ever flown with. Before the trip, I confirmed my pet in cabin several times with several different representatives over the phone. A day before the flight, I called, just I case - and found out that my pet was not confirmed. Since they had never sent me an email with my itinerary or with pet confirmation in the first place, though I kept asking, they forced me to pay $400 to change my ticket. Because there were no spots for a pet in cabin, they changed me to a later date and to a different city. I lost a bunch of other connecting reservations, several days wages, etc. Also, they set up an additional checkup at the gate and search passengers luggage and showed me a fake printout supposedly from USA's TSA that says something about liquids over 100ml not allowed and told me, ""this is your country's regulations"". I quickly googled up the real TSA page, where it says that TSA allows up to 1 liter of hard liquor, as long as it's in a sealed Duty Free bag with the receipt inside. But they took my whiskey anyway.",0
  Los Angeles to Hong Kong. The seat and new bedding were very good. The meal service was rushed and below average. The breakfast was just not good. After the first meal service no drinks were offered and the flight crew disappeared. The next time you saw the crew was at the breakfast service. I think next time I will choose a different carrier. ,0
"  The airline facilities were fantastic. It was my first time flying business in the Qsuite with Qatar Airways as I was travelling from australia to Europe. When waiting to board the flight there was no priority lane for business class passengers. Once I had boarded, I would have appreciated a better welcome and more information regarding the services on board. Unfortunately I was mostly ignored by staff when I got into my seat except when I had the do not disturb sign on. I was awakened as the air steward who he needed to know my meal preference. It was a 14 hour flight. I do not understand the urgency from the staff. It defeats the purpose of even having a do not disturb sign.  I was not offered any bedding on the flight. ",0
"  Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use “old version” or “new version” I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of – why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn’t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there’s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.",0
  Istanbul to Podgorica. Both flights were on time. Smooth check in. New aiircraft and very clean. Staff friendly enough and even for the short distance we had drink and food. Nothing to complain.,1
"  Paris to Chicago. Very attentive, courteous service in flight by the cabin crew on AF 0136. I wish our US domestic carriers could follow suit I highly recommend Air France.",1
  Brisbane to Dubai. I am a skywards gold member and has used this airline for few years. The quality of late has been inconsistent with some sectors offering fantastic service but some offering poor service. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy over more loyal passengers. I will be taking my business to another airline as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore.,0
"  Qatar Airways is undoubtedly the best airline. From booking my tickets on line to online checkin, airport services, in flight comfort, cabin crew, transfer at Doha, everything was just amazing. Although tickets were comparatively expensive however services were value to money.",1
"  My recent experience with Turkish Airlines has been extremely disappointing. I used to be a loyal customer, but my recent flights have been nothing short of a nightmare. The flight from Prishtina to Istanbul was delayed for hours, from 8:25 pm to 11:50 pm, with no communication or updates provided. To make matters worse, the flight from Istanbul to Doha was abruptly canceled, leaving passengers in complete darkness with zero information. Upon reaching the airport, I was greeted by an outrageously long queue. While Turkish Airlines did arrange a hotel for us, it was located two hours away from the airport. By the time we were able to check in, it was already 6 in the morning. My rescheduled flight for today at 8:45 pm has been subject to continuous delays, and I am currently stranded at the airport with no information or assistance. Even my attempts to seek help at the Turkish Airlines care point were futile due to the never-ending queue. This entire experience has been a nightmare, and I have never felt so let down by an airline. I can confidently say that I will never choose to fly with Turkish Airlines again. This level of irresponsibility and lack of communication is simply unacceptable. It's been a horrible ordeal that I wouldn't wish on anyone.",0
"  New York to Delhi return via Dubai. The staff  did not seem properly trained. The communication is difficult because some staff cant speak English very well.  At Delhi airport, I was three hours early ready to get on board but some  employee told me to stand in line to get checked in. They didn't properly guide us or let us board the flight. The line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. I discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him I am not happy with the service. His response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. On the flight to Delhi, we requested an Asian meal but they denied to gave us an Asian meal on the flight, which I found very strange. After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ""SSSS"", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously. The flight from Dubai to JFK was better, but again, they failed to serve us any Asian vegetarian food. I will not be flying with this airline in the future.",0
"  Munich to Bahrain via Istanbul. I have had a horrible experience with Turkish Airline. We missed our flight due to them not updating the screens in the airport to Boarding status. All other flights were doing that, as I was watching the screen being updated for every flight very frequently. I thought the flight is simply late. And we didn't notice people queueing because we were in a sitting area not facing the gate, simply relying on the screens to show boarding status like all other flights do. So we waited and waited while watching the screens. But all my alertness was of no use. We were there early yet missed the flight. They denied their fault and deflected the problem back on us. The made us pay 3500 USD worth of money, plus accommodation we had to pay ourselves to stay near the airport for a day. I will never forgive Turkish Airlines for what they did.",0
"  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.",0
"  Emirates customer service has certainly dropped their game since I last flew with them a few years ago. An overnight flight from Barcelona to Dubai - simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. This is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from Sydney to Dubai (to which they answered they do as its 'long haul'). Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one. I'll stick to Qatar Airways in future when flying from Australia abroad, far superior service.",0
"  London to Abu Dhabi via Doha. It was my first time flying with Qatar Airways and I was very impressed. Plane was really lovely inside, comfortable seats and 'lobby' entrance with lovely lights effects was stunning. Good selection of food and drinks and professional cabin crew. It was really above and beyond. I recommend this airline for people who looking for comfort and good service. Hope will fly with them again.",1
  Paris to Montréal. The Cabin crew was very friendly. The seat was very uncomfortable and the premium economy food and drinks the same as economy class. It is definitely not worth spending so much money for this low quality.  Aircraft was old and dirty.,0
"  Istanbul to Milan. I was carrying only a cabin luggage, had already checked in before arrival at airport. It took just 15min from arriving at airport until after Passport security. Boarding starts 1 hour prior to flight, unnecessary long, because when I was on time at the gate I still had to wait like 20min until boarding started. Flight was pleasant, they offered me wider seat to make me more comfortable. The crew was nice and kind except for one guy, he has forgotten was smiling means. Food was excellent. Entertainment was excellent. But be careful the service and staff quality is decreasing while the prices are increasing.",1
  Atlanta to Paris. I always thought that Air France is a good airline. I used them several times and I want people to know that crew on board the plane is fantastic no problems there whatsoever. However it really sucks when you call customer service to find out if they found the missing luggage and the person behind the phone treats you like your just an amount of dollar not a human being without your clothes and medication. I've never being humiliated in that way in my life.,0
"  
Munich to Doha. The flight is currently done by a new LATAM airplane which I assume is leased by Qatar Airways. The cabin crew and the entertainment system however is Qatar Airways. I’ve experienced a very friendly staff at the check in as well as within the cabin. Even with the regular seats they are pretty comfortable.",1
  Very bad experience from this airline. Our route was Stockholm -- Istanbul - Sharm el Sheikh and back. Both flights to and from Istanbul to Sharm had been cancelled for no reason and we were forced to choose another flight one day later with long transit time (over 7 hours). We paid for seat reservation but no seats were reserved. Cabin crew weren't nice and helpful at all. ,0
"  Venice to Male via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways because of the lower pricing and good time schedule. The flight experience has been quite amazing even in economy class. The food was good, and beverage was served constantly during the flight to keep us hydratated. Crew on Qatar Airways is the best you can find, they are very polite and kind, treating you like a king in particular if you are a member of their frequent flyer program like I am. The aircraft on all four flight was an A330-200/300, and comfortable. On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft. Aircraft age was the main negative aspect of this trip, but on all four aircraft there was a wide selection of music, tv, film, games. All four flights were on time and ground service in Doha was good.",1
"  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting. This is simply the worst experience ever.",0
"  
Milan to Marseilles via Paris CDG. Lost our luggage for 3 days before we got it all back. Terrible communication, totally dysfunctional process, no one could tell us where our luggage was or when we would have it.",0
"  Paris to Taipei. Excellent experience on this first EVA Air flight. Nice ground service, fast and efficient. Access to Star Alliance lounge in Paris, which is nice, cosy and with fine food and beverages. Priority boarding quick. In flight experience was great, starting with a top quality service from attendants. Seat is confortable. Mattress and pajamas are nice touches. Toiletries bag one of the best I ever had. Entertainment could have a larger and better selection of movies. Food excellent, wines good. A remarkable service quality overall that makes me looking forward to my next EVA Air trip. Also fly return, with same if not better experience, so consistency another plus from EVA Air.",1
" Tokyo to New York. Excellent service began from check-in, with dedicated check-in room and security screening area. ANA Suite Lounge was nice, but I some how found SQ Private Room at Changi, QF First Class Lounge at SYD and the Concorde Room at JFK better. My flight was exactly the day after ANA launched its new 777 configuration to JFK, so I got stuck with the old version. However, the cabin was sparkling clean and showed no need for upgrading. My complaint was mainly about obstructed view from the Cube, and lack of storage space providing the size of the suite. Lavatory was underwhelming for first class, especially when comparing to my experience on the new SQ Suites just a week earlier. Catering was excellent, as expected from ANA. I picked the Western menu with a lot of skepticism but then was surprised about how tasty the dishes were. The wagyu steak was indeed overcooked, as anticipated on board a flight, but it was, at the same time, tender, juicy, and flavorful. ANA 777-300ER had excellent external camera, but they decided to turn it off upon landing, so I could not have a great landing view as I normally enjoyed with other airlines.",1
"  First time on Qatar using BA miles. I find it hard to understand why this airline is so appreciated. It’s no better than any other. Food is average with hot drinks not being served with breakfast due to the danger of spilling. Half the cabin crew are good and efficient, the other half are not. The A350 is good and comfortable with sufficient legroom, the 787 less so. ",0
"  Cairo to Manila via Istanbul. We came from a long trip in 3 countries and flight going home from Cairo, was Turkish Airlines. Our experience from our tour turned into nightmare when our connecting flight with the same airline going home to Manila left us. We knew our rights as passengers on this case and asserted it, but this airline did not make our 24 hours wait in the airport comfortable. We learned that they cannot issue us e-visa because we were not Shengen or US visa holders, so we understood that we cannot avail their free hotel accomodation in the city plus avail free airport transport. The least they could do to compensate their shortcomings to us is to at least accommodate us in a hotel inside the airport or have us stay in their lounge. Their wifi was limited for only an hour and was not enough for us to communicate with our loved ones, as well as do transactions with our associates in Manila as their shortcomings to us affected many of our business activities and other commitments. With the food, we have to get stub every 5 hours before we can eat. Its a long walk to go there then walk again going to the restaurant. The staff are all rude and does not really care. I wonder why your have ""Care Points"" with people who does not care.",0
"  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made. ",0
" Bogotá to Paris. Air France business class is excellent! I flew from Bogotá to Paris, flight attendants were very attentive, friendly and professional. The full flat bed seats are very comfortable, I slept almost during the entire flight. Food was good (food is amazing when flying from Paris). The Inflight entertainment is great, many movies (old and recents ones) Totally enjoy flying with Air France.",1
" I am very disappointed with Air France service and customer support and would convince everyone to avoid this airline in future. It was not possible to reach support via phone (support line was not even posted on their website, moreover no one responded), or official app. Help desk was closed, though it should have been opened according to the opening hours. I contacted help via app to find out where other help desks were located in CDG airport, but I was denied to obtain any answer, I was told to find out it myself. My flights were delayed due to the strike in Paris, and it turned out once in trouble Air France does not care about their customers, and holders of Flying Blue loyalty program. I obtained new ticket for flight to Washington next day, but obtained no hotel to stay because of delay. Also quality of service and seats onboard was poor. Avoid CDG airport and Air France if you can!",0
"  On 29 May 2022 I had flight (TK873) from Teheran to Istanbul at 5,15AM and then a connection (TK1861) from Istanbul to Rome. I had to arrive in Rome at 10AM. The flight from Teheran to istanbul delayed by more than one hour, thus I lost the connection to Rome. Nobody was waiting for me at Istanbul airport nor helped me at least to try to get the flight to Rome. Moreover, I went to the Business Transfer Desk of Turkish Airline and a very rude person told me that the only possibility was to fly the morning after to Rome, because all the flights of the same day to Rome were full. Then, I shown my disappointment and the person of the Transfer desk was also more rude. At the end, he found for me a flight from Istanbul to Munich and then to Rome. So I arrived to Rome at 6,25PM instead of 10AM, after several flights. Then, I complained with the person of the Transfer Desk and he answered that when I asked the first time he only checked whether there was available seats in business class and not in economy. However, after half an hour the seats was any more available. After few days I wrote a negative feedback directly to Turkish Airline and they answered that they were sorry. ",0
"  At Haneda Airport, I encountered terrible ground staff. They seemed reluctant to have passengers check in at the counter insisting customers use the kiosk to print their boarding passes and baggage tags. There were staff members present, but they seemed to be in a bad mood or too tired and didn't want to help passengers with issues they were facing. I always thought that Japan Airlines' service was full of enthusiasm and proactive in assisting customers, but that was not the case. ",0
"  Baku to Los Angeles via Istanbul. I have not even taken this flight yet, it's coming up in March and I am already frustrated beyond words with the Feedback System. When my itinerary from Baku-LAX (17 hours in the air) was purchased, I bought seat selection for extra comfort, especially the long haul from IST-LAX and return. I had to make a slight change in the departure from Baku-IST by a few hours earlier. Because of this change on the initial segment of my flight, all seat selections for the entire itinerary were cancelled, a loss of over 200 euros. I chose to repurchase the seat selection again for a cost of 200 euro. After 2 formal requests to be refunded for the loss of 200 euros in cancelled seat selections, TK simply keeps referring me to the feedback form online and reminds me that I agreed to the changes before I confirmed that change in departure date. Had the vague message at the time of ticket change been made clear, something like ""your seat selections for ALL seats on this entire itinerary will be lost"" I would have never changed the departure date. However, the corporate response from TK continues to refer me to this feedback form which keeps sending me the same unsatisfactory response. TK prides itself on flying to more countries than any other, but who cares. The focus should be on improving the customer experience when dealing with people. TK staff have no decision making power and zero ability to change anything, even after talking to the ""highest level"" of customer service. Robotic staff who repeat the same corporate jargon and policies over and over are not trained at all to deal with real people with real issues. Get it right and start treating long term customers better or your once a week flights to random African destinations don't mean much.",0
"  Singapore to San Francisco. I previously had positive things to say about Singapore Airlines, but in this case, I was very frustrated. I paid extra for an upgraded seat with extra legroom. Instead, the seat was in front of the exit door and had less legroom. In addition, the TV was broken and so for the entire 16 hour flight, I could not watch any TV. Two thumbs down.",0
"  Hong Kong - Istanbul - Copenhagen on B777-300 and A321, respectively. Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA’s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (“Devon”). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze – I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles. Only 6 seats were occupied (out of 20) on this morning flight. IFE also good.",1
"  Sydney to Hong Kong. It is sad to see Cathay Pacific fall from grace. I have flown them for many years however today was my first flight with them for over 3 years. What a shock. From the old tired plane, no warm towels, no welcome drink, no snacks, absent staff and incredibly poor meals it was all downhill. The biggest shock was the poor service. I used to recommend Cathay Pacific, no more. Very sad",0
"  Dubai to Doha in January 2017. Excellent ground services, punctual departure from assigned gate. Travelling with my wife on business. Only minus point was that there was no bridge to the aircraft - rather an old-style transfer bus. Staff was courteous on boarding. While on the aircraft, take off and landing were smooth - obviously the pilot was well trained! Food served was a delicious chicken sandwich , as well as beverages - enough considering the flight time is about an hour. In-flight entertainment was on and used my own earphones. Overall, a pleasant experience I would recommend to all!",1
"   I just cannot express how much I love ANA. They are always my preferred choice for domestic flights in Japan. The check in was a breeze, the staff from the counter all the way to the cabin crew were just amazing. For me ANA has an edge over JAL (which is an equally amazing airline) due to the baggage policy which allows 2 pieces (23 KG each) instead of only 20 KG by the latter.",1
"  We didn’t expect much (also due to some reviews here) on our trip Berlin - Istanbul - Dubai and back, but it was fine. Check-in in Berlin without much of waiting, all 4 flights more or less on time, polite and helpful flight attendants and excellent food (by Do&Co). Seats were typical economy, not worse, neither better than anywhere else. But complete and extensive inflight entertainment on all legs, incl. two outside camera views. Flight attendants tried to secure some kind of discipline in mask usage, but quite a big number of annoying fellow passengers on Turkish Airlines, more than on other airlines. Istanbul airport transfer is not really fun and especially the security control was ridiculously overcrowded and designed much too small.",1
"  Doha to London Heathrow in December 2016. Best Economy class ever flown. Seats were comfortable and in flight entertainment was great. We were on row 50 as we had an infant with us, the leg room was good for economy and near to the rest rooms. Service and staff attitude was excellent. Breakfast was okay and probably on par with Emirates.",1
"  I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.

  This is a convenient flight which leaves around 11 am and gets into Dubai at 8 am the next day. Check in was swift and boarding took place efficiently and on time. The flight departed around 45 minutes later than schedule. Seats of A380 on EK are always one of my favorite ones although this aircraft showed a lot of wear and tear. Service was very good and the crew attended all the passengers on this full flight very efficiently. Two main meals were served and there were smaller snacks that could be taken anytime. IFE remains as one of the best and inflight wifi is dirt cheap at 1$ for 500mb. We landed on time and bags were out in a jiffy.,1
"  Twice they messed up my flight. First time when I was flying to Lviv they messed up the dates ,and I couldn’t do check in because I was not in the system. The people who’s working there not professional, I spoke with over 20 different people over the phone to check what’s going with my flight, they couldn’t fix anything , and it was their fault.  So when I was going to the airport I still didn’t know if I’m flying or not. I got to the airport on rush, 1 hour before registration because I was on the line and they didn’t tell me anything and didn’t fix it. And it was international flight when you supposed to get there at least 3 hours before. But I didn’t know that was just a beginning, when I supposed to return back from Lviv that was happened again. Messed up my dates, my flight, I was holding on the line the whole night and they send me final confirmation 1 hour before registration in the morning. ",0
"  Johannesburg to Paris. The poor quality of food really disappointed us. The food and service of the French airline which would be assumed to be good in food was the worst. We told that flight attendant about a poor cheesecake dish while she was picking up the trays, and she just showed us a surprised face.",0
" Dusseldorf to Mumbai via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines used to be a premium airline for economy passengers. However, over the years they have just become horrible. I was flying from Dusseldorf to Mumbai, they cancelled the first leg of my ticket from Dusseldorf to Istanbul without my consent or without informing me. I spent 9 hours and heaven knows how much money in calling up their customer service before the day of the journey in getting this sorted and getting the ticket re-issued. The in-flight services were very poor, poor in-flight entertainment, cabin crew was rude and food was awful (on one of my 4 flights they served only meal which was non-veg and insisted that one has to pre-book ""special meals""). Any international flight has and should have at least two choices of meals - veg and non-veg. I am surprised how fast this airline has deteriorated after being a great one for a few years. Never again. Beware folks.",0
"  Moved my flight forward 24 hours at short notice with no other suitable options provided, no WiFi on the departing or returning flights, didn't credit miles to my ""Flying Blue"" account. IFE not working for the return leg of my journey (ICN-CDG). Complained 9 weeks ago, checked my claim progress on 20/07/2022 and still just showing as received. Checked again today and now they can't find it. They don't reply to calls, emails, their WhatsApp communication is with an infuriating bot which serves 0 purpose. When you ask to be passed to a service agent you'll get no reply until 2-3 days later where they explain their agents are busy.",0
"  Sao Paulo to Istanbul. Terrible service, amenity kit was gave to other Business Class passengers and not to me. In a 12 hours flight, one meal as the breakfast was not serviced even when boarding I said would rest first part of the flight and eat later, they said ok, but later said meal is not served on demand, really rude flight attendants. Asked water, they said would bring to the seat still waiting. The dinner course, was terrible, never had a so dry and hard meat, asked to change they said no extra meal. This is the kind of treatment you have at Turkish Airlines Business Class.",0
"  Dublin to Bangkok via Dubai. I had high Expectations from Emirates given their good reputation however when flying with them from Dubai to Bangkok the cabin service was rubbish. There was a 1 hour delay (Pakistani Airspace issues which is understandable) and no cabin members went around and offered us some water. After take off cabin service was generally lousy, They served us food and then vanished for the rest of the flight, when I buzzed an attended 2 hours in she comes up and says “eh sir your light is on just press it again to turn it off?.. I told her I just wanted a glass of water and I got it 10 minutes later, the same half bothered rude response was given the next time (2 hours later). I wanted a drink so I told her to get me 2 beers and I’ll leave them alone. The tables were not cleaned properly on this flight. The seats on the A380 were very soft and comfortable but they were rock hard on the Boeing 777 used for the Dublin flight. The ICE entertainment system has good music but doesn’t have good tv shows. On the positive side I had lots of legroom and my bags were delivered really quickly and handled well. Food and beverages were also good. I",0

Adana to Istanbul, night flight. Crew were friendly. They supported me with a blanket and helped with my hand baggage. Beverages were different and it's cool. But sandwich wasn't good. The bread was very dry from 4 sides, and attached  cheese wasn't good. One problem  disturbed me, I bought connecting flight via Turna.com from Adana-Istanbul-Almaty, Turkish Airlines and Air Astana, but in Adana on baggage registration desk they couldn't connect my baggage till my last destination.

"  Flew on Business class with Qatar from Athens to Tokyo Haneda via Doha. First leg of the flight was on a A320 with the old layout of business class seats which are the worst from what Qatar has to offer as they don't go into bed mode and aren't as nice as the newer ones, but it was ok for a 4.5 hour flight. Service was good and so was the food offered. On the second leg of the flight we flew on the Boeing 787. Indeed a spectacular aircraft with great layout, vey comfortable seats. The amenities given along with slippers, and pyjamas were top quality. The staff were very attentive and again everything was perfect from start to finish, Can't fault it.",1
"  Excellent service by a friendly service minded cabin crew. Old plane upgraded with Qsuites. Still hard uncomfortable seats but nice with the privacy. Light meal after take-off but when ordering the burgers were already ""sold out"". Left with soggy fish and chips that went back to the galley.",1
  Delhi to Singapore. The second time I flew on the A380. The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional. The only things that bothered me on this particular flight was they lacked international food to serve that I was served Indian food which I’m not used to. Another hitch was the on-line check-in where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only. Thank you.,1
" Hong Kong to Berlin Tegel via Istanbul. This was my first time flying Turkish Airlines and I heard positive and negative comments so I'm quite surprised with the good service they provide on both flights. Crews are friendly and are willing to help. The food is excellent too, really special choice of food / desserts, and they provide stainless steel cutlery. One thing is that I had problems with choosing seats in advance online but I did not receive useful response through email. Other than that the ground and flight crews have good attitude.",1
"  Sharm el Sheikh to Frankfurt via Istanbul. Both outbound flights quite okay. Pleasant staff, my husband's normal meal was average. My special meal was rather nice, twice the same. Film choice very poor, mainly testosterone filled movies or old sob stuff. Very few films available in German. English films hard to understand because of bad sound system and/or cheap earbuds. Return: On time, same poor entertainment. Although my low calorie special meal is registered in my frequent flyer profile, on both legs I had to accept normal food, the second inedible half raw scambled eggs. TK's good service is decreasing!",0
" My wife and I flew to London and returned with Korean Air from Sydney via Seoul, Incheon. KAL was the best value ticket available and included a complimentary night in Incheon on the outward leg of our journey. The quality of the accomodation was 5 star and beyond expectation. In total we had four flights two on Airbus 350 and one on a 747 and one on the A380. The Airbus are all newer aircraft and offer an exceptional flying experience. The 747 was noisier, but the cabin had been retro fitted to a consistent level of quality. The seats in economy are a calm blue or brown colour, are the widest I have experienced in economy and offered ample leg room for my 6ft 2 frame, even when fully reclined. There are no obtrusive underseat boxes. The touch screen inflight entertainment screens are large and offer a cosmopolitan selection which although not as big as some, has something for everyone. Every seat has a point where you can charge your devices, but there is no wifi in economy. There were little bottles of water and headsets on the seats pre boarding. The crew are all impeccably presented in a beautiful cream and green uniform that is a nod to Korean celadon ceramic wear. The food is exceptional if you like the Korean option with the signature dish of bibimbap and doesn't even look like airline food. The western choices are more standard airline presentation. Our son received child's meals and these were colourful and provided a variety of healthy items and sugary treats to suit all levels of fussy. The children's headsets are so cool I was jealous. The boarding procedure was straightforward and we were priority boarded ex Seoul due to travelling with children. The toilets in economy contain high quality branded toiletries and were kept meticulously clean on all flights with crew stationed outside through the quiet times of the flight. The crew themselves were highly professional and had good English. They were attentive to call bells and helpful when asked questions. They are impressively patient with passengers who misunderstand cabin protocol or ignore the seatbelt signs and manage the safety in a charming and caring way, rather than a bossy aggressive manner that can occur on western airlines. On the A380 there is an actual duty free shop at the rear. I have no complaints whatsoever. These were the best four flights that I have ever been on, comparing similar long haul experiences on JAL, ANA, BA, Singapore Airlines and Thai. I believe that the quality is similar to Cathay Pacific but I like their uniform and Korean service style slightly more.

"  Sydney to Sofia via Dubai. I booked ticket. My flight was cancelled from the company. When I asked for full refund as my ticked was not nonrefundable and I was expecting full refund they told me, no matter what, they will charge me cancellation fee. That is twisting people's hands. Terrible service, their representatives ask me to call them but it is impossible, the phone number doesnt work. How you dare to charge cancelation fee when you cancel the flight. You are not able to provide service and even do not know when this will happen , but offer a voucher as a credit note.",0
"  I checked my suitcase in 2 hours early. Then the flight departed an hour late. Boarding staff kept us all standing around until 15 minutes before the flight was supposed to take off before boarding us. After take off it took staff 2.5 hours to offer me a drink. When we arrived an hour late at Doha, staff rushed us through to the British Airways connecting flight. I still queried how my baggage was going to be rushed to meet the connecting flight and was told it was being taken care of. I arrived this morning in London Gatwick to no suitcase.  I am on my knees praying my bag is found. There were several other people also with missing luggage. Very upsetting.",0
" I flew out from Brisbane, stopover at Seoul, before continuing to my destination Japan Tokyo. During this 13 hour trip I found this airline to the most disappointing so far in my travels. I have previously flown with Cathay, Thai and Malaysia and they've been pretty good (Cathay being the best in my opinion). This airline was disappointing because they always skimp on the water levels in their cups given out every time. I'm on a plane, that is the last thing that I need - to be even more dehydrated! To those people thinking of flying you are better off buying your own bottle of water before you go. Seats were uncomfortable and at a weird angle. For that reason I highly recommend choosing a different airline for long distance travel. Seats were also quite compact and not spacious. Inflight entertainment was average and on one of the planes its remote control was stuck to the screen with a wire. What I mean by that is that everytime your window seat buddy needed to go to the toilet and needed to pass me in the aisle seat, the wire was in the way making it a clumsy design. Food was very average. Never going to fly Korean Air again.",0
"  Singapore to London Heathrow. I haven't flown SIA for over 5 years, and was looking forward to renewing my experience. Overall a pleasant trip, but they seem to rather a shadow of their former self. I guess they are getting attacked by low cost airlines and Middle eastern airlines that have stolen many of their customers? Staff were efficient during the set times for service, but outside that this is a rather disappointing level of attention for business class. I had flown LAX to Tokyo one week earlier with ANA business class and have to say they are streets ahead of SIA from a service viewpoint. Seat on this A380 was comfortable, a little hard to sleep on, but quite private. Meals seemed quite small and dull compared to former standards. Used the inflight entertainment at beginning of flight and quite a nice choice. I probably wouldn't put them as first choice next time - they are a whole lot better than BA, but that is like comparing a low cost airline against SIA.",1
" Since COVID, Singapore Airlines service has been going down and prices going up, Phnom Penh to Paris which was approximately between 2800 and 3300$ is now around 5 to 6000$. They don't give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference.",0
"  Economy seat was wider compared with other airlines, legroom was bigger - the person sitting in front of me reclined her seat but it was tolerable. Food was excellent: they served bibimbap; scrambled eggs for breakfast were soft and fluffy (really nice). You can ask for snacks such as peanuts and instant noodles (Shin ramen, which can be too spicy for some people). As in most airlines, if you want soda, they do not give you the entire can, but they do give you an entire beer can though. The cabin was clean, and the flight attendants keep the toilets clean during the flight. Not too many choices of films and TV shows but it was not a deal-breaker for me; use your earphones (with one jack) instead of the usual scratchy headphones they give out in most airlines. KAL requires the use of face masks throughout the flight but does not announce this before you board - they should; they do provide face masks to those who did not bring any but it's less of a hassle if passengers knew this requirement during booking or at least during check-in. I was happy enough with this flight and will book with KAL in future.",1
"  Copenhagen to Mumbai via Doha. For the CPH-DOH leg we were in the older Business Class layout, for the DOH-BOM we had Qsuites. While the Qsuites are outstanding, I think there is something to recommend the older layout, too - it feels more open and and it is very spacious. Inflight service on both the legs was superb. Qatar's (paid) wifi also works well. The Al Mourjan lounge in DOH can get crowded but on this occasion we hit it at a less busy hour. Qatar offers probably the finest onboard Business Class product today. The company has work to do regards customer service and support outside the aircraft.",1
"  We flew Johannesburg to Singapore on SQ479 on July 7th in Business Class and experienced the worst most arrogant crew ever. I travelled with my wife and 2 Daughters (2 and 4 years old) and we were assigned seats 19F and 20D and F. As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row? Maybe SQ needs to inform pilots who is paying their high salary.",0
"  Athens to Shanghai via Doha. I could not check in online for my trip to Shanghai, I tried multiple times within 36 hours of the flight, and I had successfully checked in online for my outgoing flight Shanghai-Athens. The website stated ""sorry, we could not check you in at this time, please try again later"". Not being able to check in online, I had to wait for 45 minutes at check in, where I was told that I had to pay extra for the 3 kg over the 30 kg baggage allowance, at 45 euros per kg. After removing 2.5 kg from the luggage and putting it in my carry on, I was told I had to pay for the extra 0.5 kg. I had a very tight connection at Doha, part of it scheduled, part of it because the flight arrived late and they bussed us to the terminal. I rushed to my connecting flight and I made it, but my luggage did not. I filed a delayed luggage report at in Shanghai. The suitcase came with the next day's flight but it was delivered 8-9 hours after the flight arrived.  On board the service was good, the F&B average, inflight entertainment good, but they don't make up for the above points.",0
  The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour.  I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available (even if they claim they are on the website).,0
"  Tokyo Narita to Sydney. My first issue arose when attempting to check-in online within the prescribed period. The JAL system would not allow me to complete check-in, advising I had to contact my travel agent. This was bizarre, as my ticket was purchased from JAL direct! At Narita Airport I was directed to the Premium Economy check-in. When I presented myself at the counter to which I was directed, the staff  told me they were closed, and took me to another counter which was also closed! Staff subsequently turned up and completed my check-in, however, the check-in process was disorganised. Flight departed on schedule. Food quality was of a poor standard. I had expected better from JAL when departing from their home base. I had also expected to find some typical Japanese dishes on the menu, but they were absent. Flight was not comfortable, as the crew had the climate turned up and it was way too hot and made it too uncomfortable to sleep. Most passengers in PE were visibily hot, as people removed all but necessary clothing and didn't use the aircraft blankets - requests for reduction in cabin temperature were ignored. Initially I presumed that to acclimatise us to the colder weather in Sydney they would reduce cabin temperature as we approached Sydney, the ambient temperature in Sydney being 6C. However, this was not the case. I was still sweating when I left the terminal and went into the open air. Flight arrived on schedule, however, disembarkation was very slow to be implemented and seemed disorganised. I understand that First and Business Class have priority, however, there was a long delay to allow others to disembark after all the First and Business class passengers had long since disappeared into the terminal. Overall, not a pleasant experience on this flight with JAL. On the basis of this flight, I could not recommend JAL to others.",0
" SQ25, JFK-FRA, in Business. Check in Counter, did not know how to put a Final Destination on my luggage, and instead insisted that it go to FRA, and get rechecked in. Finally a supervisor came over, and showed them how to put my luggage through. Virgin Lounge was nice and comfortable, although few available meal options. Boarding was fast easy, crew came around to take orders, and offer me a blanket. Slim menu choices, with no Don Perignon, but as we are in COVID, I accepted what was offered. Seat was extremely spacious, and comfortable. IFE was a disaster. I have been flying with Singapore Airlines since 2008, and 24 November's Flight was a appallingly horrific turnaround from what I've previously experienced. Difficult to use as well. Landed in FRA, and proceeded to next flight. Can't wait to fly Singapore Airlines Business Class again, but on a longer route, and hopefully out of COVID.",1
"  London to Bangkok via Istanbul. I traveled with Turkish Airlines on business class back to Bangkok. The check-in was fast as there weren't any queue and the staff work very professionally. i received a priority pass at the security. The airport is huge so I need sometime to walk to the gate. I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern. The flight arrived on time in Istanbul. The airport was crowded, old and had lack of renovation. Fortunately, I had an access to the lounge which was large,clean but crowded, lack of food options and seats. I spent and hour before head to the gate for my flight to Bangkok. The airport was huge and I nearly missed the priority boarding as the time board show the gate late. The service and facilities was the same as the previous flight but the seat included the amenity kit which is really useful on this 10 hour flight. The crew weren't friendly on this flight and not motivated. The flight arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon on the next day on time. I received another priority pass to went through the passport control. My bag arrived on time also. Overall, the airline itself had a good service and business class facilities but the crew should be more friendly and the airport issues should be fixed.",0
  The flight from BNE to DOH in November 2022 was very pleasant in QSuite and with an amazing staff and great food. I was very happy. The flight from DOH to ZRH on the other hand was on a very old plane and staff didn't seem motivated. My Virgin Australia flight from MEL to BNE got cancelled and Qatar did give me the choice to go without that leg or cancel the entire flight. I had to organise the rebooking myself and they kept sending me e-mails about cancelled flights which every time I had to investigate to find out that there were no cancellations. The Customer service of Qatar ignored my complaint and did not respond.,0
"  Hong Kong to Singapore. I found the Cathay proposition to provide excellent value, 10k miles redemption for a 4 hour flight. Ground check-in was seamless, zero queues. Seats in economy certainly are average, but I'm sure I've had it worse with some other airlines. I was comfortable enough to sleep for 3 hours on this flight and the only remaining time awake was meal time. IFE had a vast selection of options and these were new systems installed on the slightly older planes. They still offer some of the widest and most varied destinations coupled with reasonably good service. Not the best, but good enough for what I paid.",1
"  Avoid AF if at all possible. Arrogant & rude cabin crew and the worst food I’ve ever received in the class of flight. Starting point was the cabin wasn’t fully ready even when the aircraft doors were closed ready for push back. Finally offered a welcome drink and I requested a Perrier Water but it never arrived and was later informed that, on the French national carrier, there wasn’t any. Dinner arrived and was so poor in terms of quality that I opted for some packet biscuits & chocolate. Wouldn’t have said no to some crisps but guess what - there were none. Took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the ‘dinner’ service as all bar one of the crew disappeared. The best that can be said about the breakfast meal is that at least the fruit was edible - just. At least the seat became a full flat bed but my advice is avoid Air France.",0
  Poor customer service and they just don’t care. Flew JFK to CDG with no issues but on return trip before entering passport control they made me weigh my carry-on bag which was 12kg. They then made me add my personal item (backpack with computer) to the scale and told me I was overweight and needed to check my bag. Very rude and unprofessional. Charged me €50 to check a carry on size bag that has been all around the world on dozens of airlines. Will not fly Air France again and neither should you!,0
  Chicago to Manila via Hong Kong. Worst flight experience. My boyfriend and I were thrown up on by a toddler sitting behind us for the last 7 hours of our 16 hour flight. When I asked if we could move seats we were told no because the available seats cost more than the seats we paid to fly in. In what world is it acceptable to expect a customer to sit in front of a child getting sick for 7 hours when there are other available seats? I was told I would be contacted after our flight by customer service regarding this matter and still have not received a call. I’ve sent 3 emails and sat on hold for an hour trying to speak to someone. Finally got through to an agent just to be told someone from customer service would call me back.,0
" This review is with respect to the second leg of my journey from Doha to Munich. Considering an international 3hr 20  mins flight, Qatar Airways should have provided a better aircraft than the A320. The flight was packed with less seating space and difficulty in managing the cabin baggage. I had pre-booked a vegetarian oriental meal, the cottage cheese was quite hard and amount of rice was bare minimum. ",1
"  Seoul to Rome. Check-in staff courteous and helpful, particularly with seat allocation and check-in of baggage through to my ultimate destination. Queue at check-in long so the wait time was quite long. The service by the flight crew was excellent - friendly and courteous. Food choices were good (three mains) but the Korean meal (spicy octopus) was a little too spicy and I would have preferred a bibimbap. The plane was well maintained, clean and fairly new.",1
" Boston to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Check-in in Boston was painfully slow but was handled by a rather pleasant agent. Onboard the hard product was showing its age scuffed panels and ripped fabric. As with most of my flights with Turkish the air was stale and the cabin too warm throughout the entire flight. Despite requesting the temperature to be lowered on multiple occasions, the entire journey was made uncomfortable due to the hot cabin. Upon takeoff, it took quite a long time for the service to commence especially considering this was an 11:45 p.m. departure. Dinner was quite tasty and wines and champagne were of decent quality. The seat was comfortable in the flat position but I missed the oversize pillow they used to provide with the bedding which was replaced by a regular size, small pillow you would find in economy. Breakfast had lots of choices but the hot entree was poorly prepared. The biggest let down was the coffee which was warm at best. I had not flown with TK for almost a year and the decline in quality was evident. The washrooms were dirty and the staff, despite being friendly, were inefficient in the way they looked after the passengers. The IFE had a good selection but I opted for sleep instead. The flight left and arrived on time but the new airport in Istanbul meant a very long taxi to the gate. It took another 30 minutes waiting for the doors to open as the jet bridges could not be attached and the aircraft had to be moved into position manually. Overall, I am likely to take TK again but will look for alternatives as there are much better options out there for business class.",1
"  Paris to Tokyo Haneda. Firstly, the check-in counter in terminal 2E replaced the humans by machines. I’m not against that organisation. But It was completely jam packed, disorganised with just 5 or 6 assistant  for nearly a thousand passengers. There were a dozen flights that took off at the same time than the one I flew on, so you can imagine the situation in the check-in area with no other special dispositions. Secondly, concerning the in-flight experience, the seat was ok : legroom was correct, in the average. However the catering was just revolting, even if I was in economy class, I expect a minimum quality and respect in passenger services : this is a total fail for Air France. Actually plane foods are not very tasty, but for instance on 5 star airlines such ANA I was able to finish my plate, as you may imagine, this wasn’t the case at all this time. Regarding the entertainment system, it’s easy to navigate in it, the response is ok even if the touch sensibility is not really good. The bad point is on the movie selection which is very poor, not on its quantity but on its quality (again). I won’t say a comment on the cabin attendant because the service quality can widely differ between them, maybe a part of the french charm. All in all, I didn’t fly on Air France for nearly 10 years, and it was a mistake to try again. The new ads and commercials are far from the true quality, and are just a marketing strategy for an airline which is sinking. ",0
"  Melbourne to Singapore. Boarding was efficient and strictly adhered too which was great especially when some passengers tried to barge in. Economy is quite tight especially when the person in front reclines immediately for the whole flight. You have to recline yourself then otherwise your screen is right in your face. Was surprised not to get hot towels before take off and before landing. I guess cost cutting? No big deal but it used to be a nice touch. The toilets were kept clean with toothbrushes/paste sets in there, lotions ... that’s always nice. The flight attendants were run off their feet on this full flight but were still charming and sweet. The food probably was not as nice as my previous flights with them, the snack was awful. Again, its economy and expectations are never high. My advice is to bring your own snacks. Entertainment options were very good and we arrived in Singapore early too. I love SQs efficiency and reliability, friendly FAs and cleanliness.",1
  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. It’s still good and worthy for 45mins flight. They couldn’t serve meal but it’s acceptable since the flight is very short and the drink was quite good and definitely choose SIA again and there’s no regret at all for this very short trip. Thanks SIA.,1
  New York to Trivandrum via Dubai. Flight was delayed by 3hrs and the cabin crew was unfriendly. I travelled with a 3yr old and they never offered any kids friendly items in flight. We ordered Vegetarian and Hindu veg meals. Vegetarian was a little better than Hindu veg meals but wouldn’t say good. Flight attendants did not respond to assistance call button from seat. Before the flight started for landing they started collecting the blankets and ear phones back.,0
  Worst airline ever. Staff rude and arrogant. The service is really bad. The attitude of staff on the ground and flight crew was really bad. I asked for a coke in business class and was given a drink with a sour attitude. No snacks or drinks served between meals and nothing available in business class. No business class lounge or arrangements for passengers. This was the worst business class flight. Do not waste your money.,0
"  Mumbai to Antalya via Istanbul. Without explanation my ticket was changed. Got SMS and mail: My stopover would become suddenly six hours in Istanbul instead of two hours. There were several other flights from Istanbul to Antalya that would give me less delay. Had to call them, and the answer. You can cancel your ticket or you have to live with 6 hours stopover. No choice as such. No explanation either. That was already a very disappointing experience, even more since I am Elite Plus Frequent flyer with them. Send a complaint. It ok their customer service 4 weeks to come up with a nonsense answer. In the meantime they changed another leg of this ticket as well. Conclusion: No customer service. Long delay without explanation (and there were alternative flights available). Totally non interested staff at airport, online and on the telephone. Even though being a Elite Plus and Turkish Airlines, starting from today other airlines..",0
"  The first leg of this flight was on the A380 and the second was on a Boeing 787. The A380 was full booked and it’s a remarkable aircraft. Food was terrible on both flights. On the second flight I was starving and was disappointed when all I was given as my first meal was a sandwich. Then the breakfast was inedible. The crew on the flight didn’t seem to get on with each other. Rather unprofessional. Wi-Fi didn’t work. In flight entertainment is superb, credit where credit is due. Wasn’t impressed with Qatar on my last couple of flights.",0
"  Great service and food.  Flight attendants helpful. Got my special meal with gluten free buns. Had dinner in a 2 hour flight, and 2 meals on a long 13 hour flight.",1
"  For several days now I have been trying to reach JAL customer service to amend my return travel dates but have not succeeded. I called on different days and at different times. On every occasion, I was put on hold by the recorder for almost 2 hours where I was so frustrated and angry that I couldn't wait any longer. I am a Skyteam member and I chose JAL from many other carriers thinking that they are major airlines with customer service awareness and reliable after-sales support. However, It seems that I was totally wrong and disappointed. I would not recommend JAL to anyone with a flexible flying schedule as they will be disappointed as I was.",0
"  Dubai to Los Angeles. The service was very poor, the crew inattentive and unfriendly. The food ran out, the cabin was not cleaned, the wait time at check in was very long and only two staff were deployed.",0
"  I would like to extend my deepest appreciation for Qatar Airways during these tumultuous times. I am a graduate student that is bound to fly home after the completion of my studies. Firstly, the price of the flight was very affordable,  I paid less than 500usd for this flight. Qatar Airways allowed unlimited changes to flight schedule without any extra fees or charges (with some terms). I made 3 changes to my flights and they were all done via the phone to the customer service hotline, which was accessible.  The flight attendents, food served and comfort of the flight was unparalleled. There is nothing for me to complain about. I only have nice words to say about this recent flight home to Singapore. There is no doubt that I think Qatar Airways is deserving of being the top airline. I want to make a special mention of thanks to customer service officer, Andrew (I hope i got your name right) who was empathetic of my 10 hour layover in Doha and gave me options of a lounge. He was empathetic and his professionalism and friendly demeanor an asset to Qatar.",1
"  The leg space is above average, and is pretty comfortable. The cabin crew were nice and attentive. The ICE entertainment was great with a big screen, and various options to look for. The food though was okay, not that good but not bad either. I am okay with it as long as it is edible. The snacks that came along with the food were good. There is also free 10MB wifi which was good enough for me to send a text. Generally, I enjoyed my first time flying with Emirates. Not to forget, the cost of the tickets was reasonable. Kuala Lumpur - Dubai - Casablanca and return for approximately 500 Euros, which is not bad at all.",1
" Sydney to London via Hong Kong. ""What has happened to Cathay??"" How can a traditional high standard service provider come apart so easily? We have been decade long supporters of this airline flying up to twice a year, both regionally and long haul and we notice standards are clearly falling. Early 2018 for the first time we lost a day in Taipei trying to correct Cathay's internal fight scheduling system error on a reserved return flight from Taipei to Sydney to ensure we actually had a return flight. Separately and for the first time we were bumped off a longstanding confirmed mid morning departure (no explanation) Sydney to London into a much earlier flight which caused us ongoing difficulties. Also don't expect much at Gatwick Airport Departures because there is next to nothing by way of assistance. To add insult to injury the airline has recently changed the Economy Reservations process where you now have to pay for a more expensive ticket to continue to reserve your seat with them which represents a sizeable fare increase for many clients and something their cheaper direct rivals simply dont do. They say that you can wait up until 48 hours before departure to apply for a seat on the lower fare but most if not all flights are fully booked well ahead these days so thats just word games for people wanting certainty and anyone who travels knows it. As a rule we already pay more to fly Cathay so the recent seat reservation initiative by them represents no more than a thinly disguised grab for additional revenue and is a very unfortunate decision by them.",0
  Sydney to London via Singapore. The service by Singapore Airlines was amazing from start to finish. Check in staff were friendly and helpful. On both flights the cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Food was good and there was a reasonable amount of entertainment to watch on the large personal screens.,1
"  Cape Town to Singapore via Johannesburg. Friendly crew and fantastic service. The flight was 98% pax loading and cabin crew were really busy attending to passengers' needs. However, they remained professional and attentive. They are so nice and friendly. New aircraft, nice inflight entertainment system, delicious food, ample amenities in the toilets. Will definitely fly with them again.",1
"  Following an incident of the flight being moved to the next day (which can happen and was an uncontrollable unfortunate incident). But, what was controllable, was the level of customer service. No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!  Customers should never be ridiculed for not choosing an airline they no longer trust. Emirates needs a serious training of their staff on customer service, or simply just learn the term, because what I experienced should just not be an experience anyone goes through.",0
"  Houston to Jakarta via Taipei. Having flown EVA Air to Jakarta in May and having had such a wonderful experience, I decided to try them once again on the same trip. I had round trip on EVA Air to Jakarta in mid November for two weeks. This time the flight left around 40 minutes past midnight from Houston. The checking in and boarding was a flawless experience. My flight to Taipei was excellent and I experienced no issues whatsoever. I am really a very laid back person and do not bother the attendants unless I have to. During this flight there were a few people around me that made extensive use of the flight attendants and as always they are just very customer service focused and seemed fine with all the passenger issues they had to deal with. As before meal service was excellent as were the choices of meals and the quantity of food in economy. The seat was comfortable and I was able to sleep fine during the flight. The bathrooms, spotless, its actually quite amazing in an airplane with these many people for 16 hours plus.",1
"  Dubai to Chicago. Emirates used to be a great airline, as much as I am flying with it the more disappointments I face recently. The staff is with attitude, customer care representatives cant even help. Called before check in to reserve window seat, the lady did mistake and put me where she felt like. Next time I called the customer care to book the seat next to the window after 30 mins since check in started they telling me that there is no seats - like seriously the price is so not worth of the service we receive.",0
"  I had a bad experience with Emirates customer service before in the past and it didn't change. I thought this was a good airline and happily purchased an unaccompanied minor ticket for my son which was expensive already at over 1700$. I gave all required information for pick up etc. to the airline and they assured me that they have all info. Unfortunately, on my sons flying date they needed more info (which they never informed me about) and tried to call me but never reached me and just didn't board my son. The next day I complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500$ to no fault of mine. They said I could get the money back through customer service. I did complain and stated my case but I only received an unfriendly rejection. Therefore this ticket cost me 2300$ which is higher than any other airline. In addition, my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in Dubai due to Emirates fault. He had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later! This unprofessional treatment with poor customer service and delays is unacceptable. Last year I used Lufthansa with my son and no surprises/ unfair increase of rates/ no delays/ no problems- What a difference! ",0
"  Bangkok to Warsaw via Doha. Qatar Airways keeps standard at the highest level. The seat arrangement is most comfortable among all business classes (1+2+1 for the aircraft I flew) and service reminds of a high class restaurant due to small but important details. Serving drinks in dedicated glassware instead of one uniform glass, food served on china plates instead of plastic trays, engaged and helpful staff, high quality cosmetics (maybe except of Armani sets handed out previously). The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off. Taking alcohol off view during Ramadan shouldn't be the case in the international air territory in a plane full of all the races.",1
"  
Bangkok to Amsterdam via Istanbul. Delay on departure has been an unavoidable case for many airlines nowadays. Istanbul ground / boarding service was rather flat. There were no separate boarding between Economy and Business class, weird. Boarding to an A330-300 using bus feeder is one more thing that you have to bear at Ataturk airport. I have no idea how to board when the winter comes. But Turkish Airlines still an option to fly in BC with affordable fare.",1
" Short flight from Paris to London and so expectations were not very high. As expected, on a short flight like this, there was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were 3+3 and leg room was not very good. The boarding in CDG was very slow with long queues building up on the skybridge. Part of the problem was with passengers carrying bulky kitchen sink-like ""hand"" luggage. The airline should enforce the standard rules on bulky and heavy hand luggage. I had to stow my modest 4Kg ""Cabin Max"" bag under the seat! The snack and drink were adequate for the short flight.",1
  Dubai to Johannesburg. Absolute horrific customer service. As I approved I informed the lady I’m flying to Johannesburg and the count will close soon. (20 minutes) she said it’s fine I need to wait in the queue. of about 19/20 counters there was one person working. There was about 9 passengers in front of me. I waited as told. When I reached the counter finally the lady told me I missed my check in (by 5 minutes) as I was waiting. She refused to help or assist and told me I need to speak to another counter. The manager that he is just said I need to rebook and it’s not his problem. As I booked my flight through a third party (my fault) and was checked in already I lost both my flights as I was a no show. This cost me AED 4500 roughly. Emirates has really lost its wow factor with ground staff attitudes. Might as well be all automatic as they will be more pleasant. Most horrible and very expensive experience. I understand I should have come earlier.,0
"  London Heathrow to Hong Kong, sat near the back (seat 68C), in general, good service. Food of a good standard but the crew were less than enthusiastic about offering me a second beer (they said they had run out). Seat fairly comfortable, IFE good, although the outside camera function wasn't great quality. Despite being a five-year-old aircraft the Boeing 777 seems quite dated inside, especially in comparison to the A350-900 which is amazing. Departed over two hours late due to engineering issues - no air con on boarding, so we stewed until the doors were opened to allow some airflow. Managed to make up about 45 mins en route.",1
"  The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom). ",1
"  Been flying between Inda and US for the past 20 years. I am a platinum Etihad, Gold Emirates & Singapore-Kris. Booked on Qatar Airways due to availability (all others cancelled due to COVID bans). First time on Qatar. Very happy to be on a Qatar Airways  flight. In flight service is great. Food is excellent. Doha is a very clean and convenient transfer point. Kids too felt very comfortable. I will definitely fly Qatar Airways.",1
"  Gatwick to Manila via Hong Kong. Arrived at Gatwick and headed straight to check in, just one person in front of me, after a minute I was greeted by charming check in staff. There is still no oneworld lounge so went to No 2 lounge, it is OK. Boarded to seat `17A and settled in with a glass of champagne and warm nuts, the flight was quite full. Took off 10 minutes late but arrived on time in Hong Kong, the flight was comfortable and just laid down to watch TV as I was not tired. Food is very good, just the right amount. At HKG had a quick coffee and went to catch my next flight, Boeing 777, a pleasant flight but arrived 10 minutes late. The notable difference between A350 and Boeing 777 are: No wifi on B777, you can watch tv prior to taking off and landing on the A350, substantially quieter and superior air ventilation compare to B777. And far easier for me to get to Gatwick then to Heathrow Airport.",1
" Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect. I wanted Turkish Arlines to be good, sorry to say they are not, they are way behind other carriers on the Manila route, way behind other carriers on long haul routes, its certainly a case of running before they can walk.",0
"  I had expected the Q-Suites and to my surprise flew a very outdated Boeing 777-300ER. The seats look old and very outdated. I would rate this business class experience one of the poorest I have experienced in recent years. There is zero privacy, almost no storage space. To make matters worse - when I boarded the aircraft and saw this business class cabin I told the cabin chief that I expected QSuites and he began arguing that this flight doesn’t have QSuites - a few minutes later I was told that this was a mistake and that the aircraft was changed. While Qatar has won the Best Business class award  I would bet that those that voted for it did not see or experience this outdated and bad product.",0
" Always loved Singapore Airlines and flew them in all classes many many times. On this occasion flew them on a night flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Aircraft got switched from an A350 onto A380 on the day and generally that is a great thing, as always love an A380. However my bulk head seat was not the same/good option as it was on the A350. A380 Business Class bed is rather hard, so not the most comfortable to sleep in. In that regard prefer the A350/777 and the older A380s much more! I ordered a Gluten free meal and unfortunately the dinner main was pretty much inedible. Which is a shame. Breakfast was fine however. Service and crew were excellent as usual.",1
" We bought 3 round trip tickets from Cluj-Napoca to Lisbon with Turkish Airlines. Our flight from Cluj-Napoca to Lisbon (via Istanbul) got cancelled and we were informed by the airline through our travel agent in the evening before departure (we were supposed to take off next morning). We were going on a family holiday (with our 4 year old son). The cancellation wasn't followed by any alternative from the airline, we had to pursue the airline to come up with a solution but they stated that they had none, Turkish refused to transfer our tickets to another available airline, when we said that we would eventually agree to take their next available flight they refused to pay for accommodation (on this flight the stop over would have been 14/15 hrs). Turkish also stated that if we decide to use the return trip with Turkish we wouldn't get any refund at all. Basically we have lost 3 days of our holiday, 2 nights of our already booked and paid accommodation, travel insurance and we have had to pay an extra 1000 euro on a last minute booking for 3 new tickets with another airline. I would not recommend this service to anyone.",0
" Phuket to Copenhagen via Doha with Qatar Airways. Despite cut backs onboard in the recent years, service level and overall product still top notch. Service from cabin crew amazing at all times and food standard very high. Beverage choice also outstanding. Thai Airways Lounge in HKT an absolute disgrace, but not the fault of Qatar Airways. Also lounge in CPH on outbound extremely basic and a lot left to be desired. Al Mourjan Lounge in DOH still magnificent. Overall an absolute joy and would fly with them any day as a first choice.",1
"  The food and service in business class was horrible. For the dinner flight we were served a tasteless, overcooked and fatty piece of pork and the next morning the staff on the left side of the aircraft failed to serve several business class passengers, including me, our breakfast! Instead they stood in the front of the section talking to people and then cleaning up their trays before the rest of us had even been served! During the flight they never came around offering us any water. We had to go the galley and request it. ",0
"  Perth to Prague via Dubai with Emirates on Qantas tickets to get the QF points and status credits. We always work this way. Typical Emirates business class, that is to say pretty much as good as you can get. The A380 from Perth to Dubai was a very early model and starting to show its age, but still everything was up to standard and sleep was easy. New Perth lounge does get a bit crowded when the A380 is leaving and lack of pyjamas on overnight flight a minor issue, but still would not fly with anyone else to Europe.",1
"  This flight from Haneda to Kansai was very good. From boarding to leaving the plane, I felt welcome from the crew members and the ground staff. The airport facilities in Haneda are very convenient for me to use: I can check my baggage and get my paper boarding pass by using check-in machines. Drinks and the in-flight magazine were enough for a flight that was less than one hour. Next time I will choose ANA for my domestic trip in Japan.",1
" Absolutely appalled at the quality of the website and worse off, the service. Prior to the flight 2 days ago, I purchased a window seat. When checking in online, I realized that it’s been automatically switched to a different seat altogether, an aisle one. When I called into support to remedy it, I was told that the seat that I purchased has been taken up, this happens quite often. Whilst I accept that sometimes issues happen, the service by Turkish airlines made it much worse. After being told that it happens quite often, I was told the only way to remedy it is to 1. Write a feedback form with the screenshot of the payment (I don’t know why, she could see it in the system down the the exact seat I bought) 2. Wait to get the support ticket number via email 3. Call back into support with the ticket number so that they can help me try to get the seat back. What?! Why must I submit a ticket to get a new support ticket number, then call back to give the support number? Why can’t she help me straight away. After calling this out, I was then told *i” was the one who made the mistake because I checked in online when I’ve bought a seat. Thank you, I did not know that Turkish airlines website is from 1980s and I did not know I’m not supposed to check in online when I’ve purchased a seat. Absolutely gobsmacked. Oh, and I was told to be at the airport 3hrs early to fix this. Third class airline.",0
"  Kuala Lumpur to Doha. The business class seat was wonderful. Food was five star quality and was served on a regular basis. The seat was very comfy and relaxing. One helpful addition that was not found on Qatar Airways A340 is the massage feature. The screens were large and had a wide selection of different movies and TV shows. Toilets had very good amenities and ambience. The best part of the flight was the service onboard. The crew was extremely nice and helpful, and the cabin manager stood out the most in my opinion.  Overall, the whole 7 hours had passed swiftly and I will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",1
"  Sydney to Doha. Business class was full but crew were very efficient, excellent service. Seats were comfortable and large touch screen tv for entertainment system. Food service was a late dinner out of Sydney and early breakfast into Doha. Qatar also allow you to stagger your dining, setting times for when you would like dishes served which means they will reserve one of these dishes for you. Food presentation and range of dishes are more premium economy but they are very tasty. Fully flat bed is comfortable, not as wide as on Singapore but they are comfortable in flat bed.",1
"  Basel to Cape Town via Istanbul. When I arrived in Istanbul at 10pm we are informed that TK44 to Cape Town (departure at 1.55am) is delayed 4,5 hours. No reason for this Delay was announced. I received a voucher for Burger King, Sbarro Pizza or Popeys. The staff at the gate were very unfriendly. ",0
"  Vienna to Doha. It was the first time flying with Qatar Airways, and I arrived at the check in counter at Vienna airport and I was checked in from a really nice lady. I was flying coach, so was not expecting to have a first class experience, but neither in economy I would never offer a check in where the agent talks in the meanwhile that she has my baggage and my passport with her colleague about her personal staff. She was rude . Luckily the cabin crew were better and more helpful, but not outstanding, they did not know what was inside the snack they were offering. The cleanliness, space from the aircraft were really good and I loved the flight as well the IFE. If you are flying the Boeing 787 don´t sit too much in the back otherwise you will see more the wing than the sky.",1
" It was the worst trip I made overseas! Booked ticket on Qatar website and on return the luggage from DEL didn't arrive at Doha. The rude staff did not allow me to board flight to DFW! After debating with them that the booking was done by Qatar Airways and any connecting flight was their responsibility, I was finally made to stay overnight. Next day reached DFW and again the flight to my destination was cancelled! They flew me to an airport 2.5 hr away and husband had to drive 5 hr to pick me up. No amount of phone support would help. Very rude staff at Doha making you feel as if it was my fault the luggage didn't arrive. They need better logistics with partner airlines. I trusted Middle East airlines over American but its a mistake. Time tested Delta and American are still dependable. A 25 hr journey took 45h.",0
"  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time. I will never fly with them again and I would recommend others to choose another airline.",0
"  Melbourne to Manila via Hong Kong. Boeing 777-300ER outbound and A350 on the return. For some reason though I prefer the Boeing 777, must be the feeling of such a big spacious cabin, A350-900 equipment was superb as well, One noticeable feature is how quiet the A350 is. Cathay Pacific never ceases to impress on Price or experience.",1
"  Copenhagen to Denpasar via Singapore. I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll.  Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since ""it was not in the menu card"" I was told. Very strange.  On the return flight to Copenhagen the entertainment was slightly better but the food and beverage was far below the standard you get elsewhere like Qatar Airlines. The experience with Singapore Airlines was the biggest disappointment I have had since very long. ",0
  It has been 4 days and no information or sign of luggage! I cannot reach any customer service number (France or Mexico) for days and have been waiting on Facebook chat for a day now. The tracer says that the luggage was supposed to be delivered yesterday and there is no status update. I tried to add a claim and the website gives me error when I submit. I ordered special meal when flying and it wasn't there and I had to have their standard meal. ,0
"  This was a red-eye flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo. Very efficient self bag drop at Hong Kong International Airport. Organised and efficient boarding. CX's regional seats are fixed back seats, thus proving very uncomfortable for a red-eye 4.5 hours flight. Inflight entertainment audio jack malfunctioned, although fixed by cabin crew after 30 minutes. Extremely poor catering, only a snack box (a tiny sandwich, chocolate brownie, fruits and a piece of shortbread) was provided, as opposed to full warm meal for a daytime flight on the same route. No choice of drinks, only a 250mL box of lemon tea, no water, tea, coffee etc. Arrived at Narita on time, but walk from gate to immigration is extremely long, nearly 10 minutes. Due to arrival in early morning, very efficient at immigration and luggage reclaim.",0
"  This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven’t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final “thank you for flying Emirates” sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers’ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore Airlines again - far superior.",0
" Separate check in for Business Class passengers was very welcome. Spent no more than 15 minutes going through baggage screen, ID/passport screening and Checking bags. The B787-9 seats offer more privacy than the B777-300ER. There is a privacy screen between two seats together and the aisle side of the seat also has a curved screen. The seats are very comfortable and slightly narrower than the B777-300, however, there is plenty of leg room. I was able lie down fully flat. Dining is par excellence. The seafood appetizer (salmon, shrimp and tuna) with a garden salad was amazing. For the entree, salmon w/spinach watercress and mousseline chateau potatoes in pesto sauce was superb. For dessert, mango nougat mousse and chai. As with the service on B777-300, an onboard chef took our orders. Service from the cabin crew was exemplary. The inflight entertainment options were very good with live news channels, music, movie and tv show channels. WiFi was excellent. All you had to do is log into Turk Telecom with your last name and seat number on the boarding pass and you're connected. Between the B777-300 and B787-9 business class offerings, I prefer the latter because it offers more privacy. Service is the same on both types of aircraft.",1
"  Our flight from Johannesburg to Doha in September was delayed, on arrival our flight to Antalya left. Qatar Airways put us (a family of 4) on another flight via Istanbul connecting to Antalya. After a difficult and tiring trip our luggage did not arrive. I requested the luggage tags to proof that our bags was loaded on the new flight but Qatar was unable to provide any proof. We made several attempts to Qatar airlines to compensate us for the delayed luggage and other costs but to no avail. On our return on business class our flight to Johannesburg was delayed and after boarding the flight passengers was asked to disembark. The country manager in South Africa was not really helpful attempts to arrange a face to face meeting with him failed.",0
"  To check in I found the economy class queue was clearing much quicker, they said the business lounge was closed and gave me $70 voucher that no shop in the Sydney airport food court accepted, then they send me on a wild goose chase to find their business lounge in Qatar as no one knew where it was located and was sent on multiple occasions to the wrong lounge. The quality of my food was disgusting with limited options for vegetarians. ",0
"  Manila to London via Singapore. The usual Singapore airlines efficient boarding process using boarding groups on both flights. The seats on the 777 are more comfortable than those on the (refitted) A380. A pity because seat comfort is a priority on a thirteen and a half hour flight. To be honest, the old A380 seats were more comfortable than the new but the new look better. Wonderful attentive service from the FAs on both flights. The food served was good on both flights, in fact the ""supper"" (chicken thigh, mashed potato and steamed veg with gravy) on the A380 was exceptionally good for economy class. Sadly the breakfasts remain poor. They continue to serve these awful chicken sausages instead of a decent pork sausage (the ONLY thing BA does better than SQ) and the eggs are failures; either a rubbery omelette or scrambled egg that is sloppy and lacks flavour. I did notice some cost saving measures that I had not previously seen on SQ. No amenity kits, which I did not miss but no longer serving sachets of salt and pepper with the meals is a mistake. Airline meals generally lack flavour so I did miss the black pepper. There was also a smaller selection of snacks in the galley. In my view, they still beat the competition, mainly down to their superior customer service so I will continue to use them. The transit experience at Changi is also a big positive.",1
" Qatar Airways is organised and friendly. Service is top notch. The seats are comfortable with enough leg room. The food onboard is outstanding. They are always on time or close to that. The service centres and call centres are easy to deal with and will help you change flights or answer questions as best they can. Qatar Airways has an excellent online site too that makes ticket purchase a breeze, with the facility to be charged in many currencies that can be important for your credit card rules. They are taking every reasonable step to make flying safe during covid, insisting on masks and on some routes, pre-flight testing. They also give face shields to every passenger at time of boarding, and implement social distancing. All of these measures help the passenger to feel safe and comfortable in the choice to travel at this time. Qatar Airways is a truly great airline that makes every trip with them enjoyable and something to look forward to.",1
"  Paris to Venice . Air France didn't deliver my suitcase on time when I arrived in Italy. Nobody was able to tell me if it was a simple delay or where the suitcase was. Afterwards I discover through a colleague working at the airport in Paris that my suitcase was still in Paris. It was the first time I used the self checking at the airport, nobody was there to help me. I finally got my suitcase 3 days later.  When I got back from my vacation 3 weeks later I sent to Air France receipts to get the money back. They said I was too late. Air France offer a very bad customer service.",0
"  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time. I could get direct flight from Bahrain to Delhi but I wanted my family to experience the service Of Emirates and they experienced the worst experience, partially because of bad weather Delays and partially because of staff's miscommunication or no interest to facilitate the passenger with special need or request.

" Madrid to Cork via Paris. I took the ticket with KLM and a few days after travelling, one of the stops I had planned was cancelled. They change my ticket with a stopover in Paris and the first thing: I'm still waiting for the difference between the ticket that I paid more for. They don't add the previous travel insurance to the new ticket. Air France sends an email that the flight is delayed a few days before and then at 1 am when the flight leaves at 6:10 am they send an SMS that is delayed another 40 minutes. Once on the plane, it was delayed another 40 minutes. No one explains why. Inside the plane, already arriving in Paris, it is going to land and a few seconds before this, it takes off again. Why? Nobody tells us anything. It gives me an anxiety attack not knowing what's going on, all the delays we had with this airline and the. Concern that I won't get to catch the other link and I get up to ask. I am dragged by the steward by the arm through the plane to my seat. Disrespecting me and making me and those around me even more nervous because we really believed that something very, very serious was happening since the stewardess' reaction was very abrupt. After arriving in Paris I had to run to catch the next flight to Cork. I arrive in Cork and they have lost my suitcase. I file the claim, they tell me that today I will have my suitcase, that they have sent it to cork because it must have stayed in Paris and still no one has called me, nor have I received my suitcase or anything. A disaster. I will not take this airline again and I will make complaints and claims until I get bored. Because the lack of control they have, the lack of respect, etc... is not even normal. ",0
"  This is the most unpleasant business class travel experience I have ever had. My check-in luggage is missing, despite I confirmed with the check-in counter in Dubrovnik multiple times that my luggage will be delivered automatically to Japan without any manual transfer procedure required in Dubai. The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying ""do it really quick"" and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner. The company changed the aircraft without notice. I book the aisle seat but it ended up as a window seat. (Another attendant helped me change the seat. That is the only positive experience onboard.)

" Flew Miami to Mumbai via Doha. There's little wonder why Qatar Airways keeps winning awards. From the check in process to inflight service to their premium lounges, I personally haven't experienced a better airline. The inflight experience is definitely what separates Qatar Airways from the competition. The cabin crew never stops working and it's the clichéd ""service with a smile"".",1
" Singapore to Tokyo. The airline seems to have gone on a cost-cutting mode. On a seven-hour flight, only one meal served. For a premium full-service airline to do these things in disappointing. Competition on this route provides better catering options. The seat was average economy class seat. The crew was polite and professional. Overall, SQ standards seem to be declining.",1
"  Singapore to Brisbane. This is the first time we have flown this route with Emirates for a few years. The chauffeur was very friendly and polite even offering to stop/slow down for photos I was taking. The lounge was great, the food was very good as is usual in the Emirates own lounges. The hot food was very good with a good choice of Asian dishes, and we especially loved the freshly made to order dumplings. The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet. The promised drinks after takeoff was not delivered until we reminded them and also the wines we had already ordered with our meals did not eventuate until reminded a couple of times. The food was good but nothing exciting, with no dine on demand or pre ordering available which I think would be an improvement. No amenity kits, only socks and eyeshades provided.",1
"  London to Singapore. Easy boarding with punctual push back and arrival. Latest seats – I loved the wrap-round screen for the seat, almost like some other airlines first class. The steward had to put my bed down for me and I found it rather hard for sleeping on. IFE was not really 5* standard. Food and service were excellent throughout. Overall, a very high standard throughout.",1
"  Flight on time. Smooth cooperation with their partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. Luggage transfer went smooth, arrived quickly in Hanoi. In Doha I had 12 hours layover; I was eventually denied a hotel stay but had lounge access to their decent Platinum lounge. Onboard, recognised as elite traveller and was well pampered by professional attendants. They secured me 3 seats in a row by applying seat-block for me as elite flier. The plane was not fully occupied as this is a new, additional flight on this route. IFE of high class and movies renewed frequently. Food onboard improving for QR: 3 offerings at dinner, of which I had two dishes of beef, which was excellent. Beers were of ridiculous poor quality, wines were fair, including a sparkling Spanish cava. The wineglasses are so small that they embarrass the passengers. They hold 5-8 cl only. The wineglasses on my previous flight, Rwandair, are 4 times larger. Amenity kit given though rather useless. A hot snack was offered before morning landing in Hanoi. Recommended, can't demand much more for economy class. But bring onboard your own slippers, and headset. Qatar Airways' tickets have become too expensive during Corona.",1
"  London to Singapore via Dubai. I’ve flown most major airlines and Emirates wins hand down. I’ve flown with them on business and first and the service is incredible. The crew look after you and go above and beyond. Special thanks to air hostess Alix, so attentive and professional. Cabin was spotless and very comfortable. Fantastic work Emirates keep it up. ",1
  In addition from flying to San Francisco to Istanbul we used to Turkish airlines to fly between Turkey and Greece. Every flight we took was delayed. One of the worst delays was when we were leaving San Francisco. They filled up the plane and we sat there for two and a half hours because of a technical issue on the plane. The flights from San Francisco to Istanbul and back are 12 to 14 hours. There was less legroom and overall space on these flights then the short flights we took within turkey and Greece. The planes were old  and uncomfortable. It took us 27 hours to get from Athens to San Francisco and I wouldn't want anyone to experience what we had to at Istanbul airport when trying to get rebooked. Imagine hundreds and hundreds of people all at once in a extraordinary long line with several Turkish airlines officials walking around unwilling to help and not knowing what to do. One funny part was when a Turkish airlines official once every 45 minutes would walk towards a large crowd with a thick pile of boarding passes in his hand and yell out a name of a city and then yell out last names. ,0
"  I travelled Premium Economy from Hong Kong to Sydney and was interested in comparing to Air New Zealand's Permium Economy offering. Cathay Pacific is good but I favour Air New Zealand. Cathay's PE is like a step up from Economy while Air New Zealand is a step down from Business Class. Staff were welcoming and attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Pre take off drink of Champagne or Orange Juice was offered as well as hot hand towels. Food was of a good standard, with proper cutlery and wine glasses. After takeoff the PE section toilets are made available to the Economy section so at times there was a queue for the toilets, which is not so good. Headphones were not noise cancelling and I did experience interference. Overall felt Premium Economy was worth the extra price paid compared to Economy, the superior seats and extra pampering meant I managed to get in a few hours sleep that can make a difference on long haul flights.",1
"  I caught a flight Philadelphia to Delhi via Doha with multiple fractures in my foot and needed a lot of special assistance. I write this email to thank the staff at the Qatar Airways who made sure that my journey was smooth and I received the best treatment possible. From the staff at the check in desk till gentleman who dropped me till outside the Delhi airport, it was ensured that I was comfortable and all my needs were met. A special mention to Ms Uliana and Mr Saahil who were the best of people I could have met on my journey from carrying my bags helping me to even reach the washrooms and making sure my foot was comfortable through out the journey. I would like to thank the ethos at Qatar Airways. Keep up the beautiful work Qatar Airways. T",1
" Qatar is still a great airline overall, but declining in some areas.  Onboard service is fantastic, flight attendants are the best in the business, hard-working and hospitable in every way. The food is good. The seats on the A350 are nice, the B777 less so. The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through. Security screening can be hit and miss. Things allowed through some times, next time they are taken. ",1
"  The service was excellent. The cabin crew, especially those that attended to me were genuinely pleasant and warm.

"  At Denpasar airport we were not given the boarding pass for the next trip as Cathay Pacific said we would get them at a transit desk in HK. But once arrived in Hong Kong we asked to all transit desks and all said Turkish airline had no transit desks in HK airport. We had to get out, go through custom and do the check in again - and we only had 1 h to do everything we almost missed the next flight. My vegan food was tasteless.",0
"  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.",0
" Horrible experience ending in a canceled flight. We boarded on time at 3.30pm for a 4.05pm departure from BEY to CDG, and shortly after pushing back we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the gate and were told one hour later that it was fixed. However shortly after pushing back again, the pilot announced the problem was still not fixed and that the plane's radar was out of order. We were then offered to fly to Athens as the weather there was good and ""didn't require a radar"". Another AF flight would then take us to Paris. However half the passengers decided to leave the plane. I decided to stay but after more than 5 hours, we were still stuck in the plane with no food or drink served. Then the pilot said the flight was canceled because the weather had changed! A hostess started shouting at us with conflicting instructions about disembarking and then returning to our seats - a complete chaos with children crying. After disembarking it was a total mess a no one knew on which flight they would be rebooked. We ended being sent to a cheap hotel at midnight. It was impossible to get any help from AF's call center as it is based in North Africa and their totally useless staff were not even able to provide accurate information (they said there was no flight before 2 days later while I managed to get a booking the next day by talking directly to the airport staff). Adding insult to the injury, my online complaint got me nothing more than a simple apology.",0

Last but not least, the aircraft was very clean an the inflight Entertainment was magnificent. I will fly always with Turkish Airlines.",1
  The boarding was super organized with the people in the back zones boarding first to avoid clashes and unnecessary crowding in the aisles. The food was good and the entertainment was endless with something for everyone (Japanese music for me). The staff were friendly and the seats were comfortable.,1
"  1 week before my scheduled flight I was sent an email stating my flight from Zanzibar to Istanbul on May 3rd was canceled. This email gave no alternative flights or assistance to get another flight, they said it was canceled. When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours. No email or text form Turkish airlines. We get inside the airport and flight still shows on time, I call Turkish and they said it was on time. Got to the counter and was told by that the flight was in fact delayed 2 hours and we would miss our connection and they knew about it 4 hours prior to me asking. So why weren’t we told because again we are going to miss our connection to their next flight. So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home). They were not willing to do that all they said they could do was put us on the delayed flight and put me on a later flight to JFK, which now I miss connection from JFK to Florida and I need a hotel in New York.  So my friend and I check in same time with same person, but when I get to JFK I have no luggage and she does. They placed my luggage on the flight to Istanbul the next morning. This was not the service they stated I would get. ",0
"  Istanbul to Washington. Turkish Airlines is still good.  The catering on board is suffering from bean counter recommendations. Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly.  One crew member kept bringing me tea (without my asking) while I worked for about six hours. She always had a pleasant smile throughout the trip. I wrote this review to ensure that the crew's effort did not go unnoticed.",1
"  This almost 11 hour flight happened in a brand-new aircraft. On-board entertainment as well as the seats were just perfect. As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.",0
"  Paris to Singapore, One of the lousiest flight I ever took! The seat was broken and the airline can’t find any replacement. The TV equipment at some of the aisle were also broken. I filed complaint but no feedback to date.",0
  Bangkok to Zurich via Dubai. Boeing 777 seat is not comfortable but A380 seat is very good. Food is ok and inflight entertainment is so good. I will recommend A380 only.,1
  Service and food was super. The aircraft from Doha to Athens was an 8 year old A320 with very uncomfortable seat for me. Pay more money for the business class and to fly with an A320  is really not worth it for me. There was no wifi on this flight.,0
"  Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda. They fly their latest version of 787 for this service (NH860). Business class seats have a table next to a seat, and you can put your laptop, files, etc while you eat. Seats recline into full-flat, and I do not complain about my leg room. I like this structure of seats. The food was served in a course, and wine selection was good. Cabin attendants are always paying attention to their customers. One pity was business class lounge for Singapore Airline was too crowded, and it was hard to find a seat.",1
"  Hong Kong to Prague via Dubai. I could lie down and sleep in economy class because of the low load factor.  The aircraft was well-decorated and the legroom was satisfying. nThey have the best inflight entertainment system. The tickets were relatively cheap. The cabin crew were generally friendly. Dubai is not a passenger-friendly airport. It is quite frustrating to travel around. The airport is  massive but the train does not run through the entire airport. The cabin crew had not been too eager to serve. They sat in the galley for most of the time. When a passenger needed anything, instead of hitting the bell, they went to the galley and ask for their needs. The toilets were quite dirty. Although it takes 8 hours to fly from Hong Kong to Dubai, they only serve two meals (one hot and one cold).  Passengers needed to wait for 6 hours for another meal.",1
"  Check in at Bangkok airport friendly and efficient. Even Qatars Platinum members are not allowed to use their own lounge in BKK. Their contract Miracle lounge was very average to say the least and does not deserve the name. Boarding was well organized. Cabin crew was friendly and efficient throughout the flight. Food was a big letdown, with no more butter for breakfast, no pepper and salt or a small spoon for the dessert or stirring the coffee. The main meal was disappointing in appearance and taste. Internet worked for just 20 min after reaching cruising altitude. Al Maha transfer service worked well this time after the hostess did not show up twice at the aircraft earlier this year. Platinum lounge was great. The short second leg of the trip was uneventful; the virtual entertainment system (their new 738 do not have private screens) did not work throughout the flight. Overall very average flights.",1
" Flew Singapore Airlines from Perth to Singapore. Terrible customer service and substandard conditions. Seat was ""wet"" departing Perth. Notified flight attendant and sat on blanket. Five hours later on descent, senior flight attendant came and said, ""sorry about that"". Attitude was indifferent and no effort was made to recover the situation. They're supposed to be known for their excellent customer service, it went missing!",0
"  Istanbul to Beirut. Rude, arrogant, stressed and unapologetically inattentive crew. Wifi impossible to connect to, or simply malfunctioning. Really bad experience.",0
"  Singapore to Auckland, paid to fly Air New Zealand. Singapore Airlines was the code share. A little disappointed with the Singapore leg which was the return flight. Business class practically empty so crew were not run off their feet. My husband sitting beside me was served quickly but for some reason I was left waiting on both meal times. He had nearly finished before I was attended to. When the meals arrived (dinner and breakfast) they were the worst I have had on a flight. The seats are quite comfortable and you have privacy the way it is set out. The movies are quite a bit out of date and the screens aren't touch screen so hopefully they will eventually have that. ",0
 London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx £120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx £230 for my extra bag. £110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.,0
"  When I fly from Jakarta to Zurich transit Dubai on 19 august the cabin crew was unpolite, Isit in the middle between my husband and my daughter, they ask my husband and my daughter for dinner but did not ask me so I call the bell for dinner and told that I am running out of food choices. Very disappointing.",0
"  I had a disappointing flight in business class from Washington to Dubai, flight service was 1 out of 10. From beginning of flight, the attendants ignored me, they even haven't gave me complimentary welcome package before take off and just passed me like they don't see me - I complained to them and they said they have no more left! At Dubai airport after waiting 30 min for my luggage, i became to know that they left my luggage in Washington Dulles airport. So i send them email asking for refunds and after a month on 22/09/2016 they sent me an email says they will not refund but they will top-up my mile account with 20000 miles as a gesture of goodwill. My flight was on 18 August and now we are on 21st October that I haven't even received that 20000 miles that they said as gesture of goodwill. ",0
"  Goa to London via Doha. One needs to give credit when credit is due I've always said. I've flown with Qatar Airways on and off over the years, whether it be from UK to India, India to Australia or UK to Australia. I've also flown with  other airlines all over the world and over many years. Fortunately I don't do three flights a week anymore and it's only a handful of long hauls a year now. But every time I've flown with Qatar Airways it's been a very pleasant experience. The  staff are by far the best I've dealt with for politeness and fantastic customer service. The flight details I listed above on 30th May QR523 and QR007 from Goa to London, where my 11 year old son, Frank Hewett, travelled as an unaccompanied minor, I felt so at ease with the service Qatar Airways provided. From the time they collected Frank and delivered him to my wife in London I was kept up to date on the progress and even the phone calls to let me know he had lost his mobile phone in the airport lounge. Little be known to me, Qatar Airways  upgraded him to business class from Goa to Doha. I honestly thank Qatar Airways and the staff for looking after my son and gave me the peace of mind knowing he was completely looked after from start to finish.",1
"  Tokyo Narita to Melbourne. Excellent business class seat and attentive service, Sat in 9C and you could not hear Premium Economy section. Son sat in 9A and loved the privacy of the window pod. Onboard WIFI the fastest and most reliable I have come across in the ski. Five star business class experience on-board. The First Class lounge in the Satellite area at Narita though was pretty basic. Would have been rated a 10 if the bed when flat was another couple of inches longer (note I am 6 foot 2 inches tall)",1
"  I recently flew London Karachi route via Qatar Airways, and the service I received was exceptional. From check in to boarding, the staff were friendly and helpful. During the flight, I was well looked after. My earphones were not working properly, and they replaced them twice to ensure my in flight entertainment ran smoothly. I would like to give a shout out to the cabin crew who did a wonderful job with the level of service they provided.",1
"  Zurich to Adelaide via Doha. The business class cabin of A350 is airy, the seats are comfortable to sit on, but uncomfortable in bed position. The food choices were very limited although nicely presented. I had four meals, two mains were good, one was cold and one was overcooked. The entertainment system was disappointing, a very small number of new western movies, not a lot of choice in classical music and headphones of very poor quality. The cabin crew was mostly friendly, sometimes efficient, but often unknowledgeable. All in all a disappointing experience.",0
"  Helsinki to Hong Kong via Doha. My experience 4/5 stars. The first flight everything went well, on time, polite staff, no problems. Second (DOH-HKG) on Sep 23, very good meals, good flight entertainment, on time, big remark on the Spanish attendants, very helpful and polite, specially a girl who treated us like VIP customers. I dont give a 5 star for the following reason, my luggage arrived broken! Went to the office in HK and they forced me to take 500HKD (54EUROS) for my bag, otherwise I needed to wait 2 weeks to get the money back in France. I think this is bad customer services, some airlines give you a new luggage right away. Here in Hong Kong everything is very expensive, with that amount we could not pay a new bag. In general is a good airline, they just need to take better care of their customer service on land..",1
"  Flew Cathay Pacific from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei via Hong Kong to accompany my partner who had a meeting there. Due to high season, only Premium Economy available for all legs. While my partner, managed to bought a combination of Economy (KUL-HKG-KUL) and Premium Economy (HKG-TPE-HKG). Cathay Pacific was generous to upgrade me to Business on TPE-HKG, and my partner to Premium Economy on HKG-KUL, so we can sit together. Cabin crew are friendly and well-groomed. Lounges in HKG and TPE are so large, good ambience, varieties of foods and drinks. I suggest you to pre-booked a Hindu Meal, because it is excellent. My concern (and my partner) was the emergency seat on Boeing 777-300. It is not roomy due to a bulky emergency door. On HKG-KUL leg, we get irritated with the cabin crew who made the announcement with such a strong accent that I just couldn't get what she said, despite the cabin crew who served us had a flawless and a highly comprehendible of English. Other than that, I highly recommend Cathay Pacific.",1
"  Very smooth trip from Dubai to Hamburg. Our chauffeur picked us up well ahead of time and from pick-up to entry to the Emirates Lounge at T3 it took just 30 minutes. We boarded on time and even though it was a busy service (full business class) we were very well looked after by a professional cabin crew. Food and wines offered on the nearly 7 hour flight was very good and of highest standard. We even had time to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and relax before we started our descent into Hamburg. It is fantastic that the A380 is now also flying to Hamburg and great to have both options now, the B777 and A380 on this route.",1
"  Flew Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires with Emirates. At Rio International Airport Emirates use the Gol Lounge. This is a simple lounge with no frills. The food and drinks were poor and the seating not very good. The Emirates ground staff kept Business and First class passengers queuing at the boarding gate for some time while some ""priority"" economy passengers boarded - I have never seen this before. Even when allowed to board the problem was that economy passengers had to come through the Business Class cabin, so stowing hand luggage etc. became a problem as to do so meant blocking the aisles while these passengers were trying to get past. The aircraft had a very tired feel and look. The seat layout in the Business Class cabin was 2-3-2 which made leaving your seat if you were not on the aisle a problem. The cabin staff were good and efficient. The food was possibly the worst I have ever had on any Business Class flight. Although there was supposedly Wi-Fi available I was never able to connect to it. I didn't really use the in-flight entertainment much but it was a little awkward and fiddly with a strange ""tablet"" type control which didn't seem to control anything.",0
"  Perth to Doha. Had huge problems processing a Qmiles award upgrade from Business to First class. Took 6 weeks, and 23 Support Tickets to resolve. Tried to call: Was told that the support line can no longer work on award upgrades,  please use Website But the website was broken that could not do online. Situation was made worse when my wife was upgraded to First but I couldn't. Eventually the upgrade was processed but they used my Wife's Qmiles; not mine. Another bunch of emails to resolve this. QR: They have problems with the handling of your Qmiles. And you have a second (bigger) problem where your support staff flag SRs (Support Requests) as 'Resolved' but do nothing.",0
"  Bangkok to London. What a revelation this airline was on my trip last week! Having used British Airways and Thai Airways for my flights to UK and back, I was persuaded by my travel agent to try EVA business class, and I will be back. Fabulous lounge at BKK airport that is so much better than Thai Airways offers. Boeing 777 seats in 1x2x1 layout and very comfortable - better than the others. Food was really nice, fabulous pork dish that was memorable. Crew service was impeccable and I now understand why this is a 5 star airline. Great airline, great service.",1
"  We were flying from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on 7th June, 2022. When we were checking in, looks like only 1 cabin baggage is allowed (and no personal item) while you are flying out from India. This was not the case when I was flying in from the USA. Looks like this is the rule only from India. We were charged a very high price of 35,000 Rupees for just 2 personal items which was a backpack and handbag. We had no choice but to pay. This was unheard of before. Disappointed as a customer while flying out from India.",0
"  Sydney to London via Singapore. First time I've flown with this airline since 1991, and I couldn't fault the flights at all. I'm reasonably tall (5'8"") with long legs, but I had plenty of seat room. Service was exemplary, and I liked the extra touches of menus and the little convenience bag, containing socks, toothpaste and toothbrush, and an eyeshade. Food was pretty good, and the entertainment choices excellent. Despite a tight connection in Singapore (50 minutes) I still had plenty of time to catch my connecting flight. I wouldn't hesitate to fly Singapore Airlines again.",1
"  Toronto to Frankfurt via Paris. The experience was like going back in time, the plane clearly hadn't been renovated for a long time. The seat fabric was worn, my seat pocket was torn, and for in-flight entertainment there was only one of those primitive systems that runs a dozen or so movies in a loop, each on a separate channel. In-flight service was poor, with flight attendants consistently ignoring my call button. The food was considerably below average.",0
"  I am writing to thank Qatar Airways for exceptional service during my flight from Washington to Kathmanda via Doha.  All flight attendants were welcoming, warm, and professional during both of my flights and provided first-class service. I have to say that Qatar Airways are simply the best airline in the world. Thank you very much.",1
"  Have had great experiences flying premium economy with Cathay so am upset to hear they are cutting the services into Cairns. What is the logic behind this as to go with another airline we would have to fly to Brisbane. This will add an extra 6 hrs flying to our trip which is already very long to Europe. Always when we have flown with you previously the planes were full so why cut the service now. Hopefully another airline will pick up the slack. Extremely disappointed in a decision that no-one can give me a reason for. Guess you won't be getting my custom anytime soon. Great way to support loyal customers. Very, very disappointed. Plus couldn't find anyone local to discuss this.",0
"  Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. One of the best Economy flights I have experienced. The seat is really comfortable and comes with all the perks: toiletries kit, socks, refresher, pillow etc. The elbow support on the alley side can be put to vertical position which is very convenient for oversized people. The space for your legs is most likely the widest of all airlines, even if the front seat is reclined you don't feel cramped at all. The staff is very professional, reactive and empathic towards the passengers. The toilets are large, clean and well designed. Food is good, entertainment system is nice with lots to keep you busy in long hauls. All in all, I will fly this airline again anytime. The stopover in Doha is fantastic as this is a very nice and well-thought airport with lots to entertain you. On the return flight, the connection was extremely tight (1 hour) and yet it was smooth and we got all our luggage on arrival. Thank you folks, keep up the great job.",1
"  San Diego to Fukuoka via Tokyo Narita with Japan Airlines. Outstanding service and very professional. Brand new Boeing 787  - and my flight was before the new ""larger"" economy seats (but, the older 787 economy seats were still very comfortable for the SAN to NRT journey). Onboard flight crew were attentive and met any requests with a smile (and a bow). Food was outstanding (by economy standards). Flying to Japan out of San Diego is so much easier than LAX or SFO.",1
  Definitely not the standard I would expect from a premium airline. Business class seats and layout are dated and service levels at gates and checking in are well below other competitors. The economy class is well below Qatar Airways too. Counter staff are unhelpful especially at the UK counters. I would have been better off trying Saudia instead. This is definitely not the experience of Emirates that I have had over 10 years ago. Qatar Airways really puts them to shame.,0
"  The tickets for our flight were bought online, yet at check-in, we were told the flight was full and that we had to board a different flight with a stop over at Amsterdam. We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France.",0
"  The business class experience on the QSuite is truly exceptional as I found out on another flight but as far as Economy Class goes, Qatar is far from the best. The seat was quite uncomfortable in terms of seat width and legroom. The cabin crew service was spotty, the headphones handed out when boarding was not working and it took 3 hours for the crew to find me a replacement headset. ",0
  Brisbane to Colombo via Hong Kong. In flight service ok but I booked a return ticket with short transit. They suddenly changed or advanced return day so that I am going to miss the most important part of the trip. When I requested a day later they said that day sold out - on their website still tickets for sale. They do not consider customers requirements.  Think twice if you fly with Cathay Pacific.,0
"  Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging.",1
" Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok. Despite getting negatives review Emirates is getting these days, my flights to and from Hong Kong went so smoothly. On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.",1
"  Singapore to Edinburgh via Doha. I had a wonderful experience flying with Qatar airways to Edinburgh last week! Especially flight attendant, Nicola, from Glasgow who took very good care of me as I was anxious about my very sick relative whom I was returning home to see. I was very happy with the leg room, being a tall female. The inflight food and drinks service is good. The selection of movies was extensive and varied.",1
"  Chicago to Beirut via Doha. This is the first time I take Qatar Airways. I have heard great reviews before. However, I must say that all expectations were exceeded from door-to-door or airport-to-airport.",1
" Copenhagen to Buenos Aires via Paris CDG. My Lufthansa Business Class flight from CPH was delayed, so they  transferred me to Air France, so I could still make a flight to Buenos Aires. Of course, Air France was paid by Lufthansa for this. Now Air France says they will not award me mileage points because I originally booked on Lufthansa. So Air France claims that Lufthansa should award me miles! ",0
"  Even though Taipei to Hong Kong is a vary short flight, the onboard service, was quite good. There was a full meal service, and if you checked-in on line, there is a broad range of alternative meals you can choose if you don't want to take your chances with the standard coach class meal. On the outbound flight I rolled the dice and ended up not eating the curried fish that was served. Today I pre-ordered a fruit plate that was quite satisfactory. The Boeing 777's that EVA uses on some of the TPE-HKG flight are configured in 3 classes: business, premium economy and economy. They only sell two classes, so if you reserve early enough, you can select a premium economy seat at no extra charge. Check in for Star Gold was friendly and efficient, and boarding was disciplined and orderly. There is a large selection of AVOD options, and the seat-back screens are large and clear. This was a pleasant flight experience.",1
"  Hong Kong to London. Excellent flight with friendly professional cabin crew . In flight entertainment system was large selection of Movies and entertainment, large selection of duty free and do accept verity Of method check or credit card. Service sequence was well organized. I would recommend Cathay Pacific. ",1
"  Was very excited to fly on the A350 from Doha to Frankfurt. My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons. Looking forward to my return flight on the Boeing 787 to see  how the two compare.",1
"  Beijing to Tokyo Haneda. Exceeded my expectations. ANA treating us with the same respect as first class passengers. We boarded quickly with no hassle. The aircraft is efficient and luxurious. The windows can be shaded, instead of closed. The food was excellent for airline food. The seats come forward when you recline. Instead of a indention for your cup, there was a hole so that your cup does not move. Good Boarding Music.

" Premium economy in Singapore Airlines is terrible. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the food is the same as economy and there is no separate toilet in the PE cabin (only the economy toilets). We had to ask for a bottle of water, there was no amenity kit and when we asked for socks, the kit we received contained socks and a toothbrush (no toothpaste). The staff were nice but premium economy is simply a premium price for economy quality. Next time I need to go to Europe, I'll look to transit through the US rather than Singapore.",0
" I flew with Cathay in 2017 India to US and loved them. I flew again in 2018 and I hated them. Service is poor and food was mediocre at the best. I flew from Chicago To India. Will never fly with them again. We were 3 people with a special meal plan, my 3 year old child was denied an ice cream as “special meals” do not allow for ice cream when there were many regular meal passengers who did not take an ice cream - meaning they had many ice creams in stock. One of the passengers was kind enough to give her ice cream to my son. Also there were many other bad incidents that happened during the flight. Staff was rude, we had 3 special meals and the air hostess brings 2, I informed her of another and she was rude in her response saying she had only 2 hands, this is rude and poor service. I will never again fly Cathay, I am highly disappointed with them. ",0
"  Madrid to Paris. A few days before the flight, when I tried to check in online, I realised my tickets had ""0 pieces of luggage"" included. I went to check in at the airport and my suitcase was only 14 kgs but I had to pay 40EUR and my credit card didn't work. Staff at the counter offered no help or support.  The Air France staff at the Madrid Airport was just bad people to tell it like it is.",0
"  Unfortunately we witnessed the constant deterioration of services of Turkish Airlines. The cabin staff barely speaks English, do not keep an eye on the clients, the food and especially the drinks are under the services offered 3 years ago. Our overall experience is that they cut costs by eliminating entire categories of drinks, food and in flight entertainment. We only fly with them because we do not have another option from our location.",0
"  London to Singapore. First flight with Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy and what a disappointment. It had little to differentiate it other than a little more space. I ordered via book the cook which was a nice feature although my meal was delivered first and in asking for a drink, I was told to wait a while. I asked how long that would be and was told 2 mins and then it was suggested I drink the plastic cup of water given. Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didn't make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit. The seat was not comfortable and the IFE was so poor I watched content from my PC. FA's were polite but not really interested. The 380 interiors felt old and indeed first impressions were of a budget airline. All in all poor value.",0
 Hong Kong to Singapore. The food was spectacular! The seats were nicely furnished and they were surprisingly comfortable! I would recommend the airline as they are very kind and they have patience as well with kindness and happiness!,1
"  Hyderabad to London via Dubai. We have experienced first-hand how high-handed Emirates has become lately. We are told to check-in our carry-on luggage at the gate just before entering the flight in Hyderabad en route to LHR via Dubai. Once we reached LHR one of the checked carry-on bag went missing. We got our bag finally after 3 days of minimal communication from Emirates, only to find out our laptop got stolen along with other food items. Emirates did not inform us about missing stuff when the bag got delivered. Their customer service  responses were canned and totally put the blame on us for checking in the bag. Such a shame! ",0
" After a pleasant stay in the lounge at Dubai airport, it is a nice start to the long flight being able to board directly onto the upper deck without having to go down to the main terminal level so even though they may be boarding 80 passengers it always feels a little more civilized. It is a long but pleasant flight on the great A380, plenty of room and storage with the window seats on the upper deck. Another great crew and service and again the onboard bar is a big hit and the staff who take turns at the bar always seem friendly. Two full meals are served on this long flight a lunch and breakfast with a light snack in between with a good variety of snacks available at the bar. Emirates has a good entertainment system on all their flights with something to keep everyone entertained even on a long flight.",1
"  Mauritius to Paris CDG on a Boeing 777-300ER. This flight wasn’t our first choice, as we were originally booked on a Air Mauritius flight, but were rebooked to this Air France flight because of the cancellation of the Air Mauritius flight (we knew this 2,5 months before departure). When we checked in online we were assigned two aisle seats on row 22. When we later checked our seats in the Air France app again we found out we were assigned different seats; row 20 and 54! The reason of this was a equipment change; Air France was operating a less dense 777-300ER with a lot less Economy class seats. During check in we adressed the seat issue and lucky we got new seats; 47A and B. When we sat down we felt extremely cramped; the seats were very uncomfortable with terrible leg room and appealing shoulder space. Air France is operating the 777 in a 3x4x3 configuration, and  this cramped configuration is used with an increasing amount of airlines. The PTVs were of good quality with decent content; movies, series, music, games, interactive map and a front camera. The cabin crew was very professional, proactive and polite. Both meals (dinner and breakfast) were of a good quality, but a bit small. Last but not least, the temperature on board was extremely hot during the first few hours. We addressed this to the crew and they acknowledge, but couldn’t do anything about it as the system was not reacting properly. To sum up; this was my first and most definitely last experience on board of an Air France 777-300ER. The service was fine but the seat discomfort made it one of my most uncomfortable flights ever. I would certainly fly Air France again (this was my fifth flight with them), but only if it isn’t a Boeing 777!",1
"  Manchester to Sydney via Hong Kong. I was impressed with the way we were boarded, strict listing of seats with staff asking people who were clearly trying to shove their way on, to sit down until late called. I have waited many years to see the silly passengers who run to get on first, which causes issues with them blocking aisles being told to sit down. I look forward to the return trip and hope he staff this end are as professional. I also loved the way the staff greet us at check in, stood to say good morning, these small things make the difference. Great job.",1
"  Denpasar to Copenhagen via Doha. Menu, service, facilities and comfort are on top level. Only sometimes some of the planes might have slightly worn off equipment, but staff do everything to make your trip pleasant and comfortable. That was the best flight experience we had of all our trips..",1
" Really lousy customer service, they just push a you a side like trash. For a company that is a great airlines nothing matched. All talk. They refuse to print our connecting flight boarding pass, they made us run like lunatics.",0
"  I traveled in a group with Qatar Airways from Brussels via Copenhagen and Doha to Dar Es Salaam. Unfortunately, the boarding of on this flight was denied in Doha due to payload problems (July 9th 2016). Since the next flight was 24hr later, we were offered by Qatar airways and compensation of 250USD. To claim the 250 USD we had to go Dar Es Salaam to the Qatar office. Unfortunately, there was no office at the airport for arriving passengers. We couldn't go to the departure hall since we had no valid ticket to leave Dar Es Salaam. In Zanzibar airport, the office was closed. Back in Qatar, they said at the transit office that we should go to Brussels and claim it there, and Brussels they told us that we should have claimed the money in Doha. Although the flights were great, services in the airports a real mess.",0
"  Seattle to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. The flight departed puctually from Seattle Tacoma Airport. The flight attendants were very friendly, polite and helpful. The meals inflight were delicious However,the seat was a little bit uncomfortable for me as the pillow on the seat was hard but there was a pillow (extra) provided. Anyway, we landed in Hong Kong safely and punctually.",1

"  Houston to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Flew Qatar Airways for the first time and was impressed with their product. The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived. Business class tickets aren't cheap but for the level of service, the quality of the product and the amenities that you get with Qatar Airways, it was money well spent and an experience I will happily pay for again in the future.

"  Toronto to Brisbane via Taipei. The flight from Toronto to Taipei was 15h 45m in the air, but I wasn't uncomfortable at all. I'm not excessively tall (180cm), but big enough that I fill in the seat and can use every bit of legroom I can get. On this particular flight, legroom was not an issue for me at all and even the width of the seat was plenty for me. Being a new plane we had the wide(r) touch-screen entertainment system and the selection of movies and television shows was adequate. Even tried out a couple of the games and they were entertaining enough to pass some time. Food was hit-and-miss. On the flight to Toronto they served a pesto chicken pasta that was actually really delicious. Other meals were good or just okay. There was always something on the tray to my liking though. Service was good as well, no issues to report. The best part is that I was comfortable enough to sleep the majority of the 15+ hour flight. Comparatively, the next leg was on a much older plane (also EVA) and the comfort of the seats and the age of the entertainment system certainly fell compared to the flight prior. EVA was the cheapest option I could find for the busiest time of the year and I got my money's worth and more. I will definitely look at them first for my next trip. All rating selections are for my cumulative 4 flights from BNE to YYZ and return.",1
"  I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg. I am on the fence regarding the IFE choices, but the hardware is pretty good if you bring your own earphones (the one provided by CX is rubbish). Touch screen was quite sensitive so there is little chance of bothering the passenger seated in front.",1
"  I bought 4 EVA roundtrip economy class tickets between NRT and LAX via TPE, this was the first time I seated myself on an EVA’s economy class seat. All in all, I consider their in-flight services on par with those of other 5-Star Airlines. Recommended. On our return flight, however, an unexpected matter occurred at the time of check-in at LAX. Prior to leaving for LAX, as all family members have an ANA frequent flyer program account, I set each flight to be credited there. As my wife and I have Star Alliance Gold status given by United Airlines, through the priority lane, we checked in 4 pieces of our luggage, showing a representative our Star Alliance Gold status on the cellular phone screen. However, she didn’t intend to attach a priority tag to each piece. “Please remember we have Star Alliance Gold status,” I retorted. She said to me, “You are not qualified for the priority tags being attached to your luggage, because your flight miles are credited to ANA.” I answered flatly, “Accrual is accrual. Privilege is privilege. OK? Accrual is one thing. Privilege is another.” She didn’t seem to understand how each Star Alliance member’s frequent flyer program worked. Finally, another female representative replaced her and had the priority tug attached to each piece. But she changed our accounts to be credited, from ANA to UA without our consent. It was not until we passed the immigration that I was aware of it.",1
"  First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense.",0
"  Istanbul to Birmingham. Very happy with my flight. It was on time, seats were comfortable, plenty of choice on the IFE and the food was excellent. Cabin crew were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely use Turkish again",1
"  I am extremely disappointed in the service I received. I flew from Paris to London on Monday, however my luggage never arrived. I immediately reported it (got my file reference) at the counter where they told me my bag would be on the next flight, and I'll have my bag the following day. Now it is 4 days later I have followed up with numerous phone calls and filled in additional forms online with absolutely no response from the airline. My luggage have still not been found. ",0
"  São Paulo to Paris CDG. The ground staff in São Paulo were helpful, but I've never experienced a grumpier and haughtier cabin crew. While serving breakfast, one of the flight attendants spilled coffee on the sleeve of the brand new cashmere sweater I was wearing. She muttered a quick 'pardon' under her breath, without even looking me in the eye. I didn't even get a proper apology! The food was terrible. When we arrived in Paris, we had to disembark via old-school stairs and wait for 5 minutes in the rain on the runway before buses finally showed up to take us to the terminal building. Immigration at CDG takes forever even if you have a Sky Priority and a EU passport.",0
"  Travelled from Singapore to Auckland on the 10.25pm flight. Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing. ",1
" I haven't been flying with Cathay Pacific for over 8 years, so I thought I'd give them a try again, this time on the brand new A350 premium economy. CX uses Changi T4, which is a very modern and chic terminal, in comparison to T1 and T2. It was very impressive from check in counters, the super modern immigration and interior design. Boarding was orderly and departure on time. The A350 is truly a modern aircraft, it's noticeably quieter and up to date technologies available throughout the aircraft such as wifi, touch screen TV etc. The PE sets are laid out in 2x4x2, and is relatively more spacious with ample leg room and good seat pitch. In terms of hardware, CX did very well this time. Software wise (food and service), it was rather mediocre. Crew did not look welcoming, nor happy to be there. It was streets behind their competitor on this same route Singapore airlines. For PE, we are served economy class meal, portion are noticeably smaller than many years ago, plastic cutlery, no salt, pepper sachet and toothpicks provided, it's by request only, all scream to me big cost-cutting. Presentation, portion and taste of food was rather bland, at least we were offered a cup of Hagen Diaz ice cream to finish off the meal. The load was very full, crew were efficient to go through their duties, but there's no charm or smile at all. The good old days when flying with CX was an amazing experience was truly long gone. I bought this one way ticket last minute at a much cheaper rate than SQ. Had I prepared more ahead of time, it's back to Singapore airlines for me.",0
" Taipei to London via Bangkok with EVA. Excellent staff service, great price. New aircraft and great amenity kits. Flat bed gave me lower back pain - special meal asian vegetarian very average. Very limited collection of good movies. Emirates has set the benchmark. Only 2 hindi movies! - both onward and return flights delayed - average lounges - expensive wifi $24 for 24 hours.",1
  Cabin crew superb are let down by abysmal catering. Row 27 seats don't recline as much as others. No mention at time of booking. These seats are near toilets but problem is compounded by the acceptance of Economy class passengers being allowed into Premium economy cabin to use.,0
" I am very disappointed because the airline would not allow me to book seats until check in. Then my wife and I were assigned seats that were not together. We were unable to get anyone to even try to help. Customer service pushed us off to ticketing. We showed up at 5am for our 8am flight as they instructed, only to be told to ask at the gate. We went to the gate and asked and, without even looking in the system the gate agent just told us they would not change our seats. This was NOT the Customer service l that will make me want to fly this airline again! International premium trips are too expensive to be treated poorly. What's worse is a corporate culture that doesn't encourage problem solving/customer service. For example if they cared to try do you think they could've found 2 people in regular economy who would've liked premium economy seats? Not 1 employee thought of that. I won't fly with them again.",0
"  Air France accidentally cancelled reservation on return flight from Barcelona to Atlanta via Paris.  Counter staff were rude and made no attempt to help saying that there was nothing they could do and directed us to a un-opened customer service area which did not open for about an hour and a half and no one could let us know if they were going to open, sighting that it was Sunday. Agent at security told me that I had to check in my walking cane. Making my walking difficult. Despite having reserved and verified a wheel chair, that information was lost. Perhaps due to airlines mistaken cancellation of our reservation. My travel companions / assistants were seated in different seats of airplane. Something I noticed was the norm with many passengers'. Stewardess said she would try to remedy but never did. I asked for a beverage which attendant said was not on the cart but would return with but never did. • Overall the entire experience was very poor and stressful.",0
"  Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.",0
"   This was my first flight with Cathay Pacific since prior to Covid and having seen some negative reviews about a so-called deterioration in service on CX flights I was a bit worried. However, I found the service to be excellent. The crew were very attentive, polite and professional. The seats were good with ample leg room, great entertainment system with wide selection of movies to keep you occupied during a long flight. For sure there are cheaper air lines out there but I'm happy to pay a bit extra for a peace of mind that I'm in good hands.",1
" Had a disastrous experience with Emirates recently. I was supposed to fly from New Dehli to Dubai on a direct flight taking off at 9:50 pm. When we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and ETA planned at 00:00. Just 15 min before the planned new departure, still no news. I had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in Lucknow - 40 min away from Dehli for weather conditions. But a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at Dehli. Planned new departure: 1:40am. We then learned around 1:20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7:30 PM.with no further explanations. The whole crowd started to get mad, complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give. I learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re-flying. Emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to Dubai impossible for a long time. After more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting, and no answers from the staff, a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any. I decided to call Emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4:14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue. It took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back. Emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast. But getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport. It would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4:30 am. We decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by Emirates. At 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience, the staff claimed that it was well managed, Emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast. It drove me mad and I asked to talk to the most Senior Emirates staff member at the airport. I could not talk to him as he was busy in a meeting, not even considering the fair complaint of an angry customer. He just did not care! I am flying 100 days a year for the last 15 years and it is the most painful experience I had so far. Not only the situation was tough but the staff was totally incapable to inform us of anything, letting us wait for hours for nothing and only the buzz around informed us. Then the situation was managed in hours in a totally disorganized and disrespectful manner. Please all run away from this company.",0
"   There's a reason why Singapore keep winning awards - AKL to BKK and then return BKK to AKL via SIN. Pretty much faultless service from one doorstep to the other. Great aircraft, crew, service, food, facilities, lounges, all on time.

"  I had a complaint, I initially contacted them via Twitter but, all I got was the same message back every time asking for details (which I gave, more than once) and they just followed up again, by asking the same questions.

The return was London to Hong Kong via Doha on March 29th. I called Qatar Customer Services Team to see what options we had to change the routing of the cancelled flight and / or get a refund and my call was handled by a lady who was poorly informed re any options, and was quite rude and eventually when I questioned her she hung up on me.  I requested a refund but no refund has been received. ",0

"  On 4/11/2022 I arrived at LAX @10:45AM for flight #180 LAX to Istanbul scheduled for a 1:45PM departure. Our original 1:15PM boarding time passed w/o any communication from the gate attendants. We were given numerous boarding times until we were told hours later that the flight was canceled due to a mechanical issue. We returned to the ticket counters to rebook. There was not enough staff; same people who originally/secondly checked us in, were at the gate and also checking in the next flight. The chaos/disorganization among the way the whole ordeal was handled was SO unprofessional . Passengers were instructed several times to move to different lines causing people to lose their places in line; causing more frustration. Since the flight did not show up online or on the app as canceled but rather delayed, we were not able to rebook on our own, even though we had been told it was canceled. The next step we were told to follow was to leave our places in line and go to the baggage claim and bring our luggage back to the check-in counter. The explanation for this was that when we get rebooked, the staff would be able to quickly tag our luggage. Once again, the lines were jumbled and people were angry. The passengers that were in the front of the line lost their places, and many were now in the back. Two areas were made for passengers wanting to cancel their flight and ones who wanted to rebook. We stood for hours.  People who ordered business class felt entitled to cut the line and did so with impunity. We returned the following morning at 7am and no attendants showed up for an hour. Next flight was to depart at 1:45 PM. Crew finally showed up at 2:25 PM. At 2:45 PM a bus to took us to the aircraft, and at long last, at 3:34 PM the plane started moving. At 3:43 PM the crew informed the passengers that we were returning to the gate due to Mechanical Issues. By 5:10 PM, back in the terminal, two staff members were at least being polite and helpful, they were the manager, nd another individual named. They succeeded in getting me on a flight that evening that left at 7:27 PM. It was the worst travel experience I have ever had and that was before the nightmare regarding the return trip took place.",0
"  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as ""we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew. My conclusion is very much ""buyer beware"".",0
"  Perth to Vienna via Doha on Qatar A350 aircraft. I really enjoyed the trip back home after finishing my 2 months work assignment in Australia.

"  Seoul to Paris with Korean Air. I am traveling with my triathlon bike, which is sometimes an issue for some airlines, but there was no problem at check-in in Seoul and it was perfectly managed up to its arrival in Paris where ground staff was not as gentle with it as ground staff in Seoul. Lounge in Seoul is located quite centrally, which allows to have a quick shower and food prior to boarding. Cabin in A380 is quite standard, not in the top category compared to some other airlines as the seats are the original ones and not yet modernized. The seats are slightly transmitting vibrations from the plane and heat when set in bed mode. Quality of the meals are great, especially for Korean food (it is necessary to be accustomed to Korean food as some dishes can be quite special, e.g. chewy noodles & chilled broth or spicy octopus). I especially appreciated the service onboard. I found the crew efficient and pleasant. After the meal, I made a comment saying I would not say no to chocolate, and few minutes after they brought me a coffee with delicious cookies from upper class. They constantly check if passengers are comfortable and require anything, doing it in a discreet manner without disturbing people. From the various airlines I fly with, Korean Air has one of the best service. ",1

 This was my first time using Turkish Airlines and I was satisfied. Check in at Lyon airport was fine. The flight was full but I managed to find space for my carry on bags. The flight left a bit late. The cabin on board was in good condition and seem to be new. The crew and the service was good. The inflight entertaiment is excellent with a big screen for each sea and a great selection of different type of movies. The meal was tasty and there was a good selection of any type of drinks. The flight went fine but it took more time to land in Ataturk airport because of weather in Istanbul. Turkish airlines is an excellent airline and operates probably to the most countries in the world. I would defently fly again with them if I have a chance,1
"  They don’t honor star alliance gold. My husband purchased the ticket because he is a million miler with United.

When we finally left Turkey we were searched  at check nobody else. We got on the already delayed flight we had to get off and change plans. When we arrive at the airport all the star alliance tags were ripped off. our bags were last off the baggage carousel and wet we waited hour for our bags to arrive. We missed our rental car reservation in Newark and had to sit in the airport until open. We got there so late there was barely any employees there for customs or to help with claims. No one still has responded about our bags, but all they do is blame security but why would Istanbul security remove our star alliance priory bag tags? ",0
"  Paris from Detroit, I arrived at the airport at 11am for a 3.25pm flight from Paris to Detroit to ensure I had the necessary time to get through security and customs. As I waited by the gate for an expected boarding time of 2.25 pm and got into line, we are told there will be a delay boarding until 3.10 pm. At 3.10pm we are updated that the flight is delayed until 5.30pm and that first class, business class and premium can go to the Air France executive lounge. I walk for a good 10 minutes to the lounge which is quite far from the gate I was at. When I get to the counter to check into the lounge the attendant tells me that there was a mistake and premium does not get in free (I am flying premium) but tells me that I can pay 45 euros for access. I had to talk to my colleague to check that this would be acceptable. When I get an OK from my colleague to pay for access I go back to the counter and ask to pay for access. This time a different attendant tells me that I cannot pay for access. I explain what happened and showed her the attendant that said I could pay to access and after conversing in French they tell me no sorry you cannot access. I felt these people have no courtesy for their customer. This was my first experience with Air France. Unfortunately it will be my last. ",0

I then had to pay for a hotel room as they don't compensate accommodation and pay the extra to rebook my flight to Townsville. All up an extra $600. Never fly Cathay Pacific,0
"  I had the best flight experience, I flew DXB-SFO and return from IAD-DXB both flight were with the A380 with luxury semi suite in business class which convert to full flat bed. On both directions flights left on time and landed earl. Catering on board is 5 star standard and the best of the experience is the crew who were very attentive, always available and helping the passengers. Check in was smooth, boarding and disembarking a breeze and luggage were brought to belt so fast. I would like to thank the crew of EK225 on 20 May specially Ubaid and Christine and on my return EK232 on 17 June Danielle and the manager Rabih.",1
"  Flew New York JFK to Doha. It has been several years since I have flown Qatar Airways, and my first experience on the A350. The standard of cabin service is still very high as is the delicious catering, the IFE on the A350 is a bit iffy, especially the TV selection and games are very poor. The flight tracker and cameras are of the highest quality. I plan to bring back my loyalty to Qatar Airways but stick to their 777s in the future.",1
"  This was the best flight I have ever taken. The business class seats and individual pods have been designed to be extremely comfortable and luxurious. Our attendants were friendly and accommodating, and it was obvious that passenger satisfaction and enjoyment were first and foremost. Our flight was over 14 hours, but it didn't seem like it!",1
"  Bangkok to New York via Taipei. This was my first time traveling to Asia or using an Asian airline. This was by far one of the best airlines I've ever flown. The aircraft were so clean, and the hospitality on the flight was amazing. We had two meals, 3 snacks and endless beverages. The seats in economy weren't the most spacious I've had but it was perfect for me, and the seats are comfortable and the touch screen tv is great for a 16 hour flight. I will be flying with them again for sure.

"  Qatar Airways remains, in my opinion, the best airline in the world for service, delivery and value for money. Whilst the A330 fleet is getting a little old, the on board service remains 5-Star - always warm, always personal and never intrusive. The whole experience from check-in, to lounge, to flight and arrival is exceptional. This is the airline others should compare themselves too as it sets a benchmark for consistent quality, reliability and service in the skies.",1
"  My girlfriend and I flew with Qatar Airways from Amsterdam to Doha a few days ago. The whole experience was great - checking-in, counter service, boarding, seat and leg space, entertainment program, exiting, etc. A special shout out for the food between Doha and Bangkok which was probably the best I ever had on a plane. The only thing why it is not 10/10 is the loading speed and UX / UI of both, mobile and desktop booking process. They seriously need to upgrade this as it is a bit painful and it takes a long time. As an airline, however, I can highly recommend them!",1
"  Istanbul to Geneva. I chose an aisle seat in front of economy and at the gate find I have been bumped to a middle seat at the back. You pay for a wide legroom aisle seat and upon boarding find that you are in a standard seat. I am sick of filing complaints and getting their standard answerback : ""operational reasons"". A couple of months ago I was on an A330 where by luck I got my wide legroom seat but 5 passengers at the back who had also paid for wide legroom seats did not. THY has yet to discover passenger rights.",0
"  Dublin to Zürich via Paris CDG. Flight was ok, but in Paris the transfer distance was too long, we arrived at the gate for our following flight at the ""departure time"". But that wasn't the worst. They lost our luggage in Dublin, so they should send it later. But they sent it to Italy and we live in Switzerland. As we tried to get in contact with Air France noone picked up the phone nor did they answer to E-Mails yet. The homepage which should help people to get in touch with the support didn't work properly. ",0
"  I and my son boarded Qatar Airways from Entebbe via Doha to Madrid. The services that we received on board the flight from Entebbe to Doha were terrible. The staff assigned to serve our section skipped us every time food, drinks, snacks were being served. This was quite embarrassing as I raised my hand when he skipped us so as to get served. When we were almost getting to Doha I raised up my hand and another staff responded. I explained to him the ordeal, he looked so apologetic and offered to serve us anything of our choice. My next flight from Doha to Madrid was the best despite that we lost our luggage for after 4 days.",1
"  I paid for a reservation of a specific seat and they confirmed with my online ticket. After arriving at the airport i received a ticket for a different seat. After approaching the staff about this, he pretty much told me that this is my problem and he wasn't going to do anything about it. Once again it was a paid seat and they did nothing to compensate the loss for me. ",0
"  Sydney to Tokyo Haneda route in August 2017. Had read many glowing reviews and was very excited to fly with such well regarded airline. I was not disappointed. Their air hostesses take customer service to the next level, being professional and very polite. ANA fly a much more convenient route to Tokyo from Sydney than Japan Airlines, going to Haneda airport instead of Narita (Haneda is much closer to the city than Narita). ANA also fly quiet, more new aircraft (Boeing 787-9) than airlines like QANTAS which fly the same route and a similar time with much older aircraft (747). The 787 allows better air regulation in the cabin and can deal with turbulence quite well which helps with sleep in a red-eye flight. It was nice to have a flight where the food tasted really good. Was at restaurant quality which is surprising for airline food. IFE was pretty good, with a decent selection of new movies for all ages, including some of my favourite studio ghibli films. Seat was pretty comfortable with a good amount of leg room for someone who is almost 6 foot in height. Overall this airline was fantastic, with awesome service rounding off a great flight experience, I would 100% recommend this airline for anyone travelling to japan, and will consider as a first option when travelling in the Asian region",1
"  Dubai to Cairo. Cabin crew members were unprofessional most of them had a poker face with a fake smile while we are entering the aircraft,  like they are not really happy serving in economy. One gave me such a bad feeling with her attitude she hit my shoulder asking me to get my seat straight so the guy behind me can have his meal.",0
" Flew Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to Seoul, CX412. The aircraft is an 33P, a regional plane with hardshell seat for economy. The seat is reasonably spacious, not crowded by any means. As a hardshell seat, the seat slides down instead of reclining backwards. It is not as comfortable as CX longhaul seats but not bad. This design eliminates most irritation from the one sitting in front. The IFE is excellent, both in responsiveness and content. It provides a sea of Western and Asian movies, TV programmes and music. You definitely would not be bored onboard this flight. The flight arrived on time. The whole flight was silky smooth, almost no turbulence or shaking whatsoever. However, while all are good, the meal is an exception. In this red eye flight, the cold meal was presented in a paper box, not the usual set up. The portion is very small. The taste is terrible. It doesn't get any better if you order a special meal. They are equally pathetic. The drinks that come with the meal is a box of Vita lemon tea which is very sweet. It is good that you can still order other drinks, such as hot tea and water.",1
"  London to Phuket via Doha. Sadly there was a bereavement in the immediate family which meant that I needed to push the flight bookings back by a week. Called to re-arrange flights and paid a re-booking fee. I requested a receipt for payment of re-booking fee (made over the phone) so I could claim on insurance. The email address they gave me was incorrect and it was quite a challenge trying to communicate with QR on this matter. On the day of travel, we arrived at the airport and were told that the booking had been canceled. We showed proof of payment, proof of payment of change of tickets. The staff at LHR were horrific in their attitude. My son, who is autistic became hugely distressed. Ended up having to buy another ticket 45 mins before departure (so now paid for the original ticket, change fee, and extortionate price at the airport for new tickets - almost 4x original ticket price handed over to QR). By the time we got to boarding gate my son was in such a state that LHR staff asked about calling a doctor to seek for medical assistance. Connection for DOH-HKT was missed so had to spend 1/2 day at DOH. Finally arrived at Phuket but the luggage had been mislaid. I have been trying to contact them since for compensation, and reimbursement but they are not responding to my emails. Horrific experience and the worst Customer Service I have had. The attitude of their staff to my son, who has Aspergers was shocking - quote ""can't he go home, does he live far from here?"".  Don't know what to do at this stage to get money back and compensation.",0
"  Bangkok to Tokyo. So I have flown on many airlines overseas now and I will say ANA is definitely one of the best if not the best. Their customer service is great, staff are friendly, the food was good and the seats were perfectly sized for an overseas flight. They were constancy feeding you which was also really nice. I think on a 13 hour flight we got fed 3-4 times, amazing. The only thing I didn’t like if anything was that if you buy a ticket through another airline with them as partner you have no ability to prechoose your own seat or to check in online. Otherwise they are perfect.",1
"  Seattle to Manila via Hong Kong. Be wary flying this airline. Worst experience ever with no compensation or remedy. Lost our bags for the entirety of our stay in an entirely different country so we had nothing and there was no compensation or attempt to rectify. Only emails saying how “sorry” they were. Then on the day we were flying home they found our luggage and still, just “sorry”.",0
"  Taipei to Shanghai. EVA Air maintained its high standard on this flight. My seat was very comfortable and had a very large amount of legroom even though it was only a 1h 30min flight. My seat was near to the lavatory, thus it was a “bad seat”. However, I faced no problem with the proximity but rather, I enjoyed the seat as the 3-4-3 configuration became 2-4-2 at the end, giving me more space on the aisle. Furthermore, breakfast was great — scrambled egg was delicious. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful as well, giving me drinks I requested for very quickly even though they were very busy. We departed and arrived on time.",1
"  Zurich to Los Angeles via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Great price, awesome food and cabin service, smooth flight and on time. Very easy change of flights in Istanbul. I'd choose Turkish Airlines again to fly .",1
"  I would advise against taking Air France travelling from India to US. My booked Itinerary was from Mumbai - Paris - Cincinnati. I kept Cincinnati as my port of entry because I didn’t want to be in a hurry to do my immigration and then catch a domestic flight. But when I went to Mumbai airport, they changed my itinerary at the last minute from Mumbai - Paris - Atlanta - Cincinnati and leaving only 2 hrs between getting down at Atlanta and boarding flight to Cincinnati. The flight from Mumbai to Paris was 3 hours late. The flight from Paris to Atlanta was 2 hours late. When I reached Atlanta and went to Delta Airlines counter, I was told that I don’t have any ticket from Atlanta to Cincinnati for that day. I had to run back to another terminal where Air France was to get my ticket confirmed and again come back to domestic terminal to board the Delta airlines flight. I boarded the flight just 10 mins before take off. My arrival time was 1:38 PM EST as per my original itinerary and I reached at 10:30 PM EST to Cincinnati which is 9 hours late. I think it is highly unprofessional of Air France to not have a confirmed ticket for me from Atlanta to Cincinnati after they changed my itinerary at the last minute.",0
"  Johannesburg to Singapore in premium economy on the late flight. The incoming flight was delayed as the preceding flight was late departing the gate, and only arrived at the time boarding was supposed to start. However following a very quick turnaround and very efficiently organised boarding, the flight departed on time. There was the usual warm welcome from the crew, who were very active helping passengers stow belongings and settle in. Singapore Airlines do not offer pre-departure drinks, unlike most airlines in premium economy. The seat is comfortable, with good legroom and recline. The calf rest serves little purpose, and is difficult to retract when deployed, which is usually by accident. It was noted that very few passengers used the calf rest. The cabin overall is very pleasant. Service commenced promptly after take off. There was no separate drinks run, which is understandable with a late departure. The meal can best be described as typical airline food, the best part being the ice cream. Service and food is strictly economy class, no crockery nor tablecloth, and from Johannesburg no opportunity to book the cook. Drinks are served in plastic tumblers, with a somewhat meagre offering. A good champagne is offered in premium economy, but in a plastic faux stemmed glass that is even smaller than the standard tumbler. No refills are offered until the trays are cleared somewhat later. Both my wife and I were able to sleep for several hours, and it seemed quite strange to be woken up from a deep sleep to be offered lunch. This was about two hours before landing, which was ahead of schedule. De-planing was quick, and immigration and luggage collection super efficient, as is the norm at Changi. Overall this was a good flight, with excellent service measured against the standard of economy. Unfortunately it is economy class service, and through no fault of the crew lacks the extras expected in premium economy. The lack of crew dedicated to premium economy is an issue.",1
"  I had to travel home in March 2023 and it was a most unplanned trip occasioned by family bereavement. Alina and her colleague in Dublin Airport (20/03/2023) were extremely kind and helpful. Alina looked after me so well, she went over and above her call of duty to ensure that I boarded the flight on time as I was having an issue with my covid cert which was not downloading. Just know that I will never forget you! I have been telling everyone who cares to listen about you and Qatar Airways! I've been telling everyone to use Qatar for their travels - as for me, I am bought.",1
"   Brilliant, five star customer service provided by Namvkwla, Tae Vi and Calvin onboard QR962 on 2nd October. Nothing was to much for them. Food was okay, seat was fine onboard the new A350-100.",1
" Though ANA is a very good airline, and both the planes and lounges are great, the lack of customer service at this time is very frustrating. You simply cannot reach them by phone. I have spent countless hours trying to reach them.  Covid is just an excuse to save huge money on service. Plus, there are no walk in offices. This will be the last time I use them. If you cannot make a change, or cancel, what is the point? The website keeps showing errors. Useless.",0
"  Although the use of an older aircraft on this route was initially a disappointment (Oslo to Istanbul), I was once again pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service provided by Turkish Airlines cabin crew. The meal, drink selection, and service were excellent. Even though there was no inflight entertainment system, business class passengers were provided with their personal tablets to watch movies and listen to music. Once again - a great flight and great service on Turkish Airlines!",1
"  Tokyo Narita to Nagoya on business class. Highly efficient check in and a very generous luggage allowance. The domestic lounge is commendable, with a reasonable quantity of choice of freshly prepared light meals and drinks. Boarding was efficient and flight attendants were very friendly. The onboard beverage selection is exceptional and the light premium Gozen meals are also very good. Highly recommended.",1
"  Nagasaki to Sydney via Tokyo Haneda on 12 October 2017. Both flights were excellent. Check-in process at Nagasaki was crowded, but all passengers were checked in with ample time to spare. The seats on the plane were in a 3-4-3 configuration, and there was a standard seat width. However, the legroom was brilliant - I was able to stretch my legs all the way, and I am 6'3"" (192cm). Inflight service consisted of a drink and a small snack. Transfer in Tokyo was smooth and was also where I experienced first-hand how helpful ANA staff really are - I realised I did not have my passport about 5 minutes before the plane was to board, and the staff immediately leapt into action. Two began furiously calling on phones at the gate, and three left to go looking around at all the places I had been in the airport. They even told me that they would delay the flight until it was found! The passport was eventually handed in to the information desk at the airport and one of the staff then went to pick it up and delivered it to me. After this somewhat dramatic start to the second flight, the rest of the journey was smooth, The legroom was again impressive, and the seats were comfortable enough for me to catch a few hours of sleep. I would highly recommend flying with ANA whenever you have the chance, and they are probably the best choice for flying to Japan.",1
"  Terrible seats. We had no space for our legs due to boxes fixed under the seats in front of us. My girlfriend had these boxes fixed in front of her, leaving her only 60% of space for her feet. Myself had only 70% of normal feet space for economy class.",0
  I find Qatar Airways as pleasant as before this COVID-19 and since international travel is getting on the way of resuming its old speed still Qatar airways is fulfilling all the expectation.,1
"  My daughter left her trumpet on the plane. We contacted Qatar Airways in December and they replied after three weeks in January saying that they had the instrument and would return it. Since then, despite the fact that we have sent many emails requesting information / updates ... we have heard nothing. In terms of customer service they have been terrible. The Qatar Airways flight flight was ok, nothing special.",0
" Hong Kong to Newcastle via Dubai with Emirates. Had such a great journey back from Hong Kong yesterday. Flew Economy from Hong Kong to Dubai and slept most the way. Got woken up for food and loved it! Arrived in Dubai, used the lounge as I'm a silver member so got a shower, ate some food and then as I was boarding for the second leg of my journey from Dubai to Newcastle I got upgraded to Business class again! It's just what I needed for my eighth flight in two weeks! Needless to say Business class was incredible, the service was flawless and I had more than everything I needed for the flight. All the flight crew were lovely. Emirates never fails to disappoint me and for all these reasons is why I choose to fly via Dubai instead of direct from London to Hong Kong with BA or Cathay.",1
" This was our first time flying Emirates and likely our last. We have taken many other business class flights before and the service provided on every single other carrier, even American and Chinese carriers, far exceeded Emirates. The hard product is excellent with the full floor lounge in Dubai, good seat and bar on the plane. However, the biggest issue is that none of the crew seems to want to be there. It’s all a production line mentality. The service falls below what one would even expect in Economy. Also the food was very inferior given past reviews we had read about Emirates. In short, given the price point we would never fly Emirates again when there are usually cheaper business class seats on other airlines with better service.",0
" Antalya to Birmingham.  I was on vacation in Antalya, Turkey with my family of 5 and my return journey would be with Turkish Airlines from Antalya to Birmingham, UK. I went to check in online just after the 24 hour window was opened. I entered all the relevant info and managed to check in all my party, myself, my wife, my younger son 13 who has Downs Syndrome and was marked for special assistance, my elder son 17 and his friend, also 17 years old. I received the relevant confirmation in an email stating clearly that my party of 5 were all checked in and were allocated seats A to E in row 23, flight TK4330. I went to print off the boarding passes and was only able to print off mine and my elder sons but on clicking the other members of my group a message was displayed stating that boarding passes were unavailable right now but they would be available to collect at the Turkish Airlines check in desk. I tried from my laptop, my ipad using the Turkish Airlines App and my son's friends android phone again using the app. Each time I was prompted with the same message stating that each of the 3 other boarding passes would be available at the check in counter. As an IT Systems professional, this did not trigger any alarm bells, no error message was displayed and the message was very concise and clear. I also had the email confirmation. The following day when I arrived at the check in counter I was told abruptly that only myself and my elder son could board the flight and the other 3 members of my party, my wife, my sons friend and my 13 year old would have to go to the sales desk to purchase new tickets for the flight the following day. As a seasoned traveller this was the most difficult situation I had ever encountered. I politely told the Turkish Airline staff at the desk that there was no chance of that happening. I explained to them very concisely what had happened and they still very unhelpful. I showed them the email confirmation and pointed out where it clearly stated that each passenger was check in and allocated a seat. They still weren't having any of it even though I pointed out that we had special assistance for my child who was now becoming very uncomfortable and visibly upset. I told them there was no way I was going to leave my wife, child and my sons friend and asked to speak to their supervisor. It was at this point they made a few phone calls and magically found 3 seats on the packed plane. On printing the boarding passes and handing them over the staff were visibly shamed and would not make any eye contact. We later learnt that Turkish Airlines had sold our missing 3 tickets to UK travellers (at a very handsome profit) who had missed their Gatwick flight. Does it get any more disgraceful than this. A modern day International Airline screwing over mothers with disabled children for a quick profit. An absolute disgraceful turn of events, I just hope this was a one off but having read similar stories I'll be avoiding Turkish Airlines like the plague.",0
"  My flight time and durations were changed by Turkish Airlines and I requested to reschedule my flight on 18th of April as I was not comfortable with the changes. I have been calling Turkish Airlines 10 times now in 16 days but still there is no any action and my flight is in 3 days. Every time I call, the customer service tells my case is in High Priority and Urgent email has been sent and I would get the response asap. I am not getting what does the Word urgent mean to Turkish Airlines. It’s been 7 days, I have been hearing that my request is made urgent and I will get the response asap. I had another call today ie. The 10th call and I’m hearing the same answer — ‘my request is made urgent and I would get the response with in 48 hours’. But my flight would be in 72 hours, how would I prepare for the international flight if you give me the response in last minute. Also its a covid situation, there are many things to be done before onboarding. This is most irresponsible and most frustrating situation, and this was not expected from a company like Turkish Airlines. Thank you Turkish Airlines for wasting my time and thank you for thinking that our time has no value.",0
"  Gatwick to Dubai. I've noticed a drop in customer service over the years I've flown with Emirates and now it's going back up. This flight was the second leg of two flights to and from DXB and LGW. Service was exceptional, especially ground service. Service at Dubai on the first leg was and is never as good as London, but still very polite. Seats seemed comfortable, and tv screen was new. Service was very good onboard. Food was yummy lunch of sausage peas and mash potato, and the beverage cart came round once and I noticed that they were skipping rows with the drink cart. Duty-free shopping magazine was OK. ",1
  My wife and I flew Heathrow to Singapore return we have never flown in an aircraft that was so cold even with our coats on and using the blankets provided it was freezing. Also the food provided was amongst the worst had on a aircraft. It’s a shame because the seats were fine and the aircrew fantastic. Also no delays at checkout and Singapore airport must be on of the best around.,0
" Tokyo Narita to Vancouver via Incheon with Korean Air. It is actually very difficult to secure a seat on a 777 (low density 9 abreast) between Vancouver and Asia during the summer months. So Korean's B747-8i flight looked like it might be an alternative, even at a substantial premium to other airlines. Unfortunately on my return leg to YVR, an older B747-400 was used. Legroom in coach seems reasonable for KE on the 8i, but seat 63H on a B747-400 felt really tight. Service was good but the comfort was the missing element. I had contemplated purchasing 3 seats for my son and I on a cheaper carrier, but had decided not to. That might have been a mistake.",1
"  
Manchester to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew economy and does not do hot towel services or give out mini amenity kits. I was disappointed that Emirates only had black or green tea as their tea options. These minor elements aren't that much of an issue but the big deal breaker was the in-flight service. On my route from Manchester to Brisbane I had 3 flights all with separate crews and the service I received on the first two flights was awful. The staff were at best indifferent and at worst extremely rude and act like they are above you and the feeling of ""How dare you ask for assistance"" came across quite strongly with the most of the staff. Maybe I just had bad luck, but I will be flying with Emirates again soon long-haul economy so I guess we will see if it was just a once off.",0
"  Manchester to Dubai in Business Class. An excellent experience from start to finish. Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down. Outstanding business class experience in all aspects.",1
" Extra legroom not possible for over 65. We booked a flight from Tashkent to Heathrow via Istanbul (12 July 2023). I am 1.97m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy. During booking on website, the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row. It's first time I've encountered this - having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation. Having accepted that Turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age, I searched the seat plan (Airbus A330-300) and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead (row 11) - not shown as an exit row. All seemed ok when I completed the booking and paid. Weeks later, I completed the on-line check-in (only possible 24 hours or less before flight) which showed our extra legroom seat allocation, but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36. The seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight. Even painful when passenger in front reclines. There seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process. Please be warned - if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then don't book Turkish Airlines - or pay more for business class. Another comment which might help some travelers - if you are transiting in Istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer. Our flight from Tashkent to Istanbul landed 20 mins late. It then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding. Another 10 mins to disembark aircraft. It then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding. The flights themselves could have been better - toilets were not cleaned, all rubbish not collected (left on floor during landing). Maps would not load on in-flight information screen.",0
"  Dubai to Amman return. I modified my return ticket from 8th September to 10th September through the Emirates application and I have the confirmation and the deduction money message from the bank. The thing is it’s canceled because an error in the system as they told me. They didn’t notify me, call me or send me an email.  I tried to check in online but I couldn’t find the ticket and when I call them they said it’s canceled and you should call us. Then I asked him the flight is about 7 hours no time what to do? He told me to pay 1500DH if I want to come by that flight. I told him it’s your mistake, they said you are right but we can’t do anything for you. So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn’t got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH. This is what I got from Emirates airline however I’m living in Abu Dhabi and I go to Dubai because I use to love this airline. I’m really disappointed and never expected that.",0
"  Tokyo to Gimhae. A few days ago I somehow lost my iPAD and personal computer at Tokyo Narita airport after I passed the security gate. I belatedly realized that they were missing from my backpack onboard my flight while taking off. After landing at Kimhae, I was greeted by  Mr Kim, a supervisor. He took the loss of my computer into his hands, helping me out from calling L&F at Narita Airport to delivering it to my hotel without much delay. I was hugely impressed by his devotion to his job and professionalism. JAL means now a little different to me after this experience!",1
"  The  ground staff, flight, in flight entertainment, meal and seat is awesome. Flight Attendants welcomed us and helped to get us to our seats. I was given a noise cancelling headphones and a clean blanket. Food was just amazing. I got some time to have a word with Flight crews and they happily enjoyed to talk with me. The washroom was clean and nicely maintained. ",1
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul Ataturk to Cairo on a midnight flight. Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.

"  Hamburg to Tehran via Dubai. We flow with a baby. On the ongoing flight it was not as we expected. Staff were not so welcoming and equipment was bad. There was a bassinet which was too high that you have to stand up to be able to see the baby. There is air conditioning which blow air directly to the baby and there was a huge tv directly on top of the bassinet which changes the view every minutes and in the night it annoy the baby. When bassinet were installed it is impossible to use table to tv. There is a trolley on airport but it is not suitable for younger than 6 month babies. There is no gate check for your own trolley. They do not accept it. I contacted and asked if i can checkin my carry on luggage which is so common for other airlines, they said i can but while getting boarding pass they did not accept it, so i had to go with 3 carry on luggage and baby seat in. Over all the going flight was not good. On the way back the first flight was delayed and i had less than 40 minutes to catch next flight and staff was helpful. Even though the flight had 50 minutes delay in take off. The return flight was better and we had better seats but tv and airconditionning issue still the same. Another annoying issue was staff does not know anything. Every question you ask they will reply the same, i will ask and let you know which never happened. The only flight which staff was helpful was from Dubai to Hamburg. The rest of the staff was not good.",0
"  Sofia to Singapore via Doha. Hit or miss it with the crew. SOF-DOH in a A321 with recliner business seats in 2-2 configuration, for a 5 hour flight a comfortable option. Crew just fantastic and make everything possible; great job! Food as always very good, drink list very decent, although Pommery Brut is not my favorite Champagne. Only negative on this leg was the not at all responsive touch screen of the entertainment system. Second leg in a fabulous A350-1000, such a roomy aircraft, quiet and featuring the famous Q-Suite, the best business class seat I have ever flown. Especially the enormous screen is really impressive! Just three restrooms for a very large business cabin somehow did not seem right at all. But although very proactive, the crew was providing a very slow service, forgot to serve my ordered wines, had to be asked 2-3 times before it was brought to the seat. Never experienced such a service flying with Qatar Airways so far. ",1
"  Flew ANA from Los Angeles to Narita to Shenyang and return. One passenger was booked using UA miles. One passenger was on paid ticket. Had trouble paying using a US credit card, then switched to a debit card the payment went through. Aircraft was clean, flight attendants are helpful and friendly. Passengers were very quiet in cabin. Boarding process was very quick. Food service were excellent. Seat pitch was 34 inches which was critical to stretch legs, better than most of 31-32 inches seats on most of the airlines.",1
"  Jakarta to Seoul Incheon via Singapore. Jakarta to Singapore. Firstly, that the legroom is pretty decent. I am about 180 cm and i still had around 10 cm space left on my knee. The inflight entertainment system was old school, but the channel and contents were up to date. The crew were very nice. The meal was okay, i had this fried noodle with beef served with bun and some fruits. There were always lot of different beverage options on Singapore Airlines which is actually great. It was a short route to Singapore and i did really enjoy the flight. Singapore to Seoul Boeing 787-10. B787-10 legroom was a bit shorter but still enough for 180 cm man like me. But the arm rest gap was a bit narrow. The configuration was 3x3x3 and i sat on the middle and two other passengers sat on my right and left side. It was quite okay at the first place, then the meal time came up. I struggled not to spill other's passengers meal with my elbow because it was narrow. The entertainment system was really new. It had a lot of different options there and it was up to date. It was 5 hours 25 minutes flight. We just had one time meal and one snack time. It was okay tho. There were 2 options such as Korean or Western menus. I opted Korean one with the menu of Bibimbap. It was just okay since bibimbap was only vegetable and beef mixed with Korean condiments and. The cabin was clean and the most interesting of this aircraft that the window shades was electric by dimming the windows colour. It was nice! This was my first time flying with Boeing 787-10 and i still like A380 or A330 better compared to this aircraft.",1
"  Istanbul to Sao Paulo. Day flight. Managed to get an exit seat so plenty of legroom. Was sat next to Galley, lots of people milling around. Crew provided a high level of service. First meal was nice, second not very. Entertainment system was good. Flight had Wifi which is always a help. Plane was clean although the decor looked old, tired. Istanbul Airport is excellent with one of the best lounges I have ever been in. Enjoyed the flight, price was very good, will definitely fly with Turkish again!",1
" On time departure from IAD and smooth connection in IST for onward flight to VIE. FAs need to improve their English which is surprisingly poor given the airline's global reach. Almost without fail, each time I asked for a drink ""full of ice"" and motioned with my hands to show a glass brimming with ice, I got a drink without any ice at all. Other interactions with crew were found to be lacking given low English proficiency. The cockpit announcement on the IST-VIE sector was almost completely unintelligible. Food was fairly good, but no better than QR or a number of other carriers. On the return, IST-IAD, a very rude passenger in 3E (I was in 4K) began berating me when I dared to use the overhead bin above his seat which was directly across from my seat. All other bins were full with either bedding for the sleep service or other pax's luggage. He shouted at me ""Why are you using my bin"", to which I replied, ""it isn't your bin, it is for business class passengers"". He continued to berate me. I told him to be quiet and reported it to the chief purser who did nothing.",1
"  Dublin to Tokyo via Dubai. I secured a real bargain rate for a first class ticket. I did not see any evidence of cost cutting throughout the experience. Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers. The Timeless spa concession at the 1st class lounge I found to be a white elephant, unable to get an appointment and they did not mention this is only available at the main concourse B, after the long walk to concourse C. The only downside was not Emirates fault. A long reroute from Tokyo because of the tensions in the area and 11 hrs of heavy turbulance with the crew struggling even with the basics.  All in all couldn't fault them given the culture of cut everything to the bone by some airlines at the moment.",1
"  Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days. The trip from Sabiha airport to our hotel itself costed us twice the price. Pray for our luggage. Hope Turkish Airlines take this matter seriously.",0
"  London - Istanbul - Mashad in August and returned in September in economy. Three of us took the flights, planes were dated but they were clean and entertainment provided on board. Due to code sharing their flights were full to the limit. Lunch and dinner very good, however we did not like the breakfast. Mashhad to Istanbul delayed and as a result of this and due to very unhelpful airport staff (not Turkish Airlines) we missed our connecting flight and had to board the next flight, arriving in London 5 hours later than originally planned. Our bags delayed by about 5 days. All this to the side, Turkish Airlines processed our claim within 7 days, I had to only send a single email and full compensation was paid. Cabin crew were fantastic and ready to help. What I am most impressed with is their claim department that processed our claim very fast and paid full compensation. Well done to them and cabin crews.",1
"  Wonderful cabin attendants. But, the food was really bad. Kentucky Fried Chicken is not a good meal unless you are children. Very disappointed in the food selection.",0
  Just a short 2 hour flight. Food was excellent - had the Pre-Order Butter Chicken. Staff were efficient. Comfy seat but no time to relax back and enjoy. No issues and would fly again. ,1
  Tehran to Toronto via Paris. I have never seen such a poor service. My flight was on 14 August with my family and my little daughter to Toronto and unfortunately Air France lost the stroller of my kid and for more than 10 days we had no call from them and finally they delivered a broken stroller with no wheels to us! So they asked us to fill in baggage claim form to make it up to us and imagine all this is happening to us during a 20 days trip with my kid with no stroller and you can not believe how much it was hard and we couldn't go out for walking or visiting any place cause my daughter had no stroller to sit on! We attended two more times to airport till our return flight to home on 07.09 but nothing happened and no body gave any attention. I waited for another week to see if anyone cares about our loss and what they did to us but surprisingly no body did. You ruined our trip and you made a very bad memory in our mind.,0
" In almost 50 years traveling this was the worst experience. Considering I was traveling in business class as platinum member. Plane was old, configuration 2 3 2. Regretfully I had a seat next to a very unpolite man. Unfortunately it was a very long flight since there was a stop over in BKK. The purser getting off at BKK told me good luck and I needed it. This man started cutting his nails, he was also unstable and pants were down every time he stood up to go to toilet. He has been noisy all 12 hours flight and had been arguing with other passengers. A nightmare cause I was the closest to him. I wanted to relax with a gin and tonic and it was not available on all plane. This was May 2022. I send a complaint and I got just a copy+paste answer from customer service Business class + platinum member customer service.",0
" I would like to thank all the staff of ANA for the excellent service and positive attitude. They are very polite. I’m in economy, and aircraft was spacious. Convenient enough for 12 hours trip. Food is great too. Flight was a bit delayed because of snow, it’s totally fine. I recommend.",1
"  Istanbul to Zurich. I chose an aisle seat 8D during my online check-in (around 16h prior to departure) and got a confirmation email. At the airport, the airline kiosk did not issue my boarding pass and instead forwarded me to a normal check-in. I had to wait 40 minutes in line and then the agent told me that for “Operational Reasons"" my seat has been changed to 25D. This is happening to me the second time this month. Turkish Airlines quality is severely deteriorating. Other passengers had the same problem and there were people arguing about their changed seats. ",0
"  They charge an extra 100+ dollars for ""extra legroom"" without disclosing the fact that this area is used for bassinets, has extremely hard to reach Electric ports, and no TV or entertainment system unlike the other seats. There is no benefit to sitting here and in fact, as a result of sitting here, I got no sleep as I was sitting next to a newborn baby during a 13 hour flight. When I request a refund for the first seat I upgraded I was denied because I'd already flown the flight and ""used the seat"". My grievances were ignored.",0
"  My in-flight entertainment system did not work at my seat for the 8h+ flight. I flagged this to the flight attendants which attempted to fix it to no avail, so I had no entertainment. I raised this with customer services upon my return home as in my opinion I did not receive the service I paid for, and I would expect a part refund however I was met with a half apology and fabrications. I was told that according to their reports I was offered an alternative seat which I refused.",0
" Flew Qatar Airways from Doha to Amsterdam. Comfortable q-suite even when rear facing. Good variety of movies and music. The BRICS mini bag is my favorite take away. Unfortunately, service was really slow. Usually, QR attendance is there within minutes of ringing the attendant’s light - but in this case, the wait was always around 15 minutes. They literally walk past and ignore for the initial 15 minutes.",1
"  Prague to Paris. I have never written a review before, however, the kindness of Air France  staff was so exemplary that I felt moved to inform  of my wonderful experience. On October 24, 2018 my husband and I were delayed in traffic by an airport shuttle. Having never missed a flight before, I was understandably trying to conceal my panic. Air France lovely, professional and kind staff couldn't have been any nicer. They assisted us in finding another flight to Paris which allowed us to continue uninterrupted back to the States. I honestly felt like I wanted to hug them. I have occasionally heard that the French could be somewhat cool, (which I am sure came from a somewhat cool individual themselves.) I would like to report that Air France staff showed the kindness and empathy that I am sure truly represents your beautiful country! Thank you for a wonderful flight with your beautiful staff. We will always choose Air France when possible. ",1
  I recently flew Qatar Airways A320 Economy Class from Doha to Sofia. Economy CABIN is still a very nice and comfortable seat. The crew was nice and friendly and food was delicious. The service is amazing for the price you pay.,1
"  When I bought my flight from Manchester to Delhi with layover in Paris via Air France site, it didn't mention anything about transit visa requirements. General search says transit visa required only for layover of more than 5-hours. I even uploaded my travel info and document info in my Air France account. When I reached airport desk they informed me I don't have a transit visa so I cannot travel to France and denied any help. I told them I booked ticket from Air France site and I have to be in India with my family. The Manchester staff was not helpful at all. ",0
"  Emirates A380 from Manchester to Dubai was modern and comfortable and staff although friendly and polite were kept very busy by a fullish flight. IFE probably the best in the sky and on a decent sized screen too. From Dubai to Jakarta was a much older plane with smaller screens but attendants just as nice. What let this airline down was the food. First flight they had only chicken left when they got to me so even though I was hungry I declined but imagine my surprise when later I saw the cabin crew tucking into the ""left over beef meals"" including the stewardess who had served me. On the second flight I was served what is probably the worst beef meal I have ever witnessed on a plane so again nothing to eat. My moto now is bring your own sandwiches whether the airline is budget or supposed premium class.

",1
"  From start to finish, the service, food, and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback.",1
"  Our initial flight was cancelled and we were rebooked 24 hours later. We did get put up in a hotel but had to stand by the customer service desk for 4 hours for the transfer. The flight we were transferred to was a 3 stop Qantas/BA flight - we had originally paid extra for the 1 stop flight. The new flight time was 37 hours and on top of that it took 3.5 hours to check in at Manchester for a 45 minute flight to London. We have since submitted a request for compensation for additional costs which includes the extra we paid for exit row seats on our Qatar flight which we never got. Trying to get updates on the compensation request is impossible, you just get another automated message if you email, the customer service phone number team says it’s not their department and they can’t help, the online chat team says it’s not their problem, they can’t help and tell you to wait - when you ask for an escalation point they shut down the chat. It’s now 5 weeks since the initial submission and no update at all.",0
"  The A350 plane is great for passengers (comfortable and quiet). However, the service in Mumbai is sub-par at best and the service on board was not good. I was unable to check-in via their website - they weighed my bags at the check-in counter in Mumbai and they weighed by back pack and my carry on. I had 8kg more than their limit and they asked to me to either pay $200 to check it in or remove excess weight. I removed the excess weight but was still 3kgs over. I asked if I could pay for the extra (3KG) and she said we don't negotiate. The Ground Staff Manager was unwilling to even engage in conversation.  On board they served the first meal within 30 minutes but did not serve any alcohol. The Stewardess said they don't serve it because it's too early and not served with breakfast.  7 hrs and 30 minutes later they served lunch, nothing served in between. I asked for a beer and the stewardess said no.",0
"  Bought two tickets but could not use them due to the wildfires in Greece. I was given an open ticket and was told I would have to pay the difference only.  Yesterday I tried to use the open ticket. Customer service does not speak English sufficient. At first the wanted $1700 extra, then $1200 extra, then $500. Today I called again and found a ticket even cheaper than the original and they wanted $656, I asked why? No answer, only that if I waited five minutes it could go higher. I told him the website price states the price lower, I was told to buy that instead without getting a refund or have my open ticket applied. They hung up several times. Their rudeness is unprecedented. I have never seen such behavior from an airline. The money is lost I am not being forced to pay more than I have to. ",0
" I discovered EVA Air at the beginning of the year and yesterday flew with them to Bangkok for the third time. Service has been consistently excellent, on the ground and in the air. Living in Geneva, I have to transfer and Amsterdam, from where EVA flies three times a week, is a convenient connection.  In brief: great value for money. Checking in in Amsterdam is a well-run operation, check in counters open three hours in advance. On-line check-in is easy and fast, and then it is just a matter of dropping the bag at the Royal Laurel counter. The Aspire lounge for EVA AIR passengers (shared with a number of airlines) is excellent - and now that renovation at Schiphol is progressing, also better accessible; however, it is quite a distance from the usual EVA Air Gate G5. Boarding is orderly, and after the preliminaries (champagne, amenity kit, cold towel) the plane took off on time. Inflight service is great - staff anticipate your needs, catering quality high level (including the option to choose your meal in advance - which I did, and I enjoyed a delicious lobster thermidor). Strikingly, all cabin staff is female, and they are well trained. Friendly, service oriented and confident. The staff regularly checks for passengers' needs. Flight captains provide useful information. With the great lay out of the cabin, I get a good nights sleep and arrived rested in Bangkok, 40 minutes ahead of schedule. Business class provides a full size toilet where you can easily change into the pyjamas provided. ",1
"  Istanbul to Bangkok. Unacceptable inflight Service. The carelessness towards passenger who do not speak English. Incomplete service duty (ignore to distribute amenity kit to me). The ignorance towards passenger’s requests. Every Business Class passenger deserves to get one amenity kit each for long-haul flight and I supposed to get mine too but I did not, even my sister help to asked, we tried our best to explain, we did not get it. The worst airline experience",0
"  One of my worst experiences to date. Do not take this airline. I went to the airport to check in just to be told that the plane had some issues and they had changed the plane to a smaller one, which meant I was on standby with a low probability to leave. After a two hour discussion with the staff, I was rerouted to Dakar, a flight supposed to take off 3 hours after my original flight, which was also delayed by one hour.",0
"  I bought a round trip business class Lite ticket under the expectation that it would be Q-Suite. I selected my seats in Qatar Airways seat app, which showed the Q-Suite layout. At ATL  check-in I was told that there was an operational issue and the aircraft had changed with an old business class seat. This happened on my return from DOH to ATL leg. As for DOH to BLR and BLR to DOH, we did get a Q-Suite and it was as expected. ",0
"  Manila to London Gatwick via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. The A350 is a wonderful aircraft. Manila to HK on B777 and it is great reminder about the difference between the two aircraft, I find it a little noisy and the TV is nowhere near as good as the A350 or the seat comfort. Check in was fast and efficient, the lounge is good. Took off on time and to my utmost surprise the whole of the business class was empty, I was the only in it. HK to London Gatwick on new A350, so quiet, so beautiful, wonderful business class seat/bed, superb TV, I can watch straight away before take off. After a light meal, I thought I would try and get some sleep, to my utmost surprise I slept for 8 hours and woke up in time for breakfast. The whole flight experience felt like I only travelled for a couple of hours.

" Overall experience with Qatar Airways is superb, considering I had a bad experience with check in counter staff at Fiumicino Airport. I am not sure if they are directly Qatar Airways’ staff or ADR staff. They give out free face shields upon boarding. The Filipino flight attendant who welcomed us felt bad when she saw me in a haggard state due to my awful experience with Fiumicino check in staff. In our language, she comforted me and made sure I was okay. It really meant a lot to me on a personal level. Both the Rome-Doha and Doha-Manila flights have spacious seats, great halal food and snacks, more drinks and a good selection of inflight entertainment. I was able to use wifi for free on the Doha-Manila flight. Despite bringing my own sanitizers and face masks, I really like how Qatar Airways also gave out useful hygiene kits that I am able to still keep as extras on my bag. While the Rome-Doha flight specifically spaced out seats for social distancing, the Doha-Manila flight seemed to be full.",1
"  Brisbane to Ho Chi Minh City via Taipei. Crew members on both flights were really wonderful, responsive, genuine, good humored and always present in the cabin. We were last to check in so straight to the gate. Once on board felt as if all passengers were treated as special. Food was OK, wine was like first class including La Grande Dame 2006 Champagne. Cabin was old, seats did not go to full bed thus sleep was a little fraught. Transit in TPE brief, went to the lounge for half a drink, the Infinity Lounge looked more like a nightclub, didn't eat anything there seemed to be good variety of food but only wine was a single bottle of red. Next flight seemed to be delayed by connecting passengers, this wasn't explained however also very pleasant despite being ""Business"" rather that ""Royal Laurel"". Large quantity of food for such a short flight, again OK but had repeated ingredients so lacked variety - most simply looked reheated and lacked finesse. Arrived about 30 minutes late in SGN but bags off very fast. Given the high standards of service I was really happy with EVA Air and despite the mediocre culinary offerings and dated planes I thought the staff were pretty much as good as any in the sky.

"  Hong Kong to San Francisco, in Business class. Overall very good. Flight to San Francisco was delayed of more than one hour, but plenty of information given and arriving destination almost on time. Flight back almost one hour earlier than expected in Hong Kong. No issue with luggage. Business seats on Cathay Pacific are quite unusual, every passenger is in a sort of square box, seat inclined 45^. Strange but very functional. Lot of small storage spaces, seat becomes a flat bed, wide and long enough even for me (1.90). Very large screen, and lot of recent movies to look at. Privacy is good and each seat has independent access, you are not disturbed by other passengers. Might be a problem if you are not travelling alone as myself... almost impossible to communicate even with the person seating on your side. Food and beverages of good quality. Cabin crew is very kind and available, no problem with English. But quality of service was not top-level as expected. Some short cuts were below standard. Meal served with a plastic tray, no choice for bread, almost no refills for drinks. Worst problem, slow service. Not good, and surprising, as on the sister company, Cathay Dragon, service was really perfect.",1
"  Lost my luggage with my valuable stuff in it. Their staff do not even pick up the phone. You lose your luggage, you are basically on your own. As some of the destination airport personnel told it is very common that luggage gets lost especially when it transfers via Ankara airport. It is frustrating to deal with them. They are irresponsible and not professional.",0
   I am disgusted by the lack of consideration and the dishonesty of this airline. They kept delaying the flight till the airport closed and flight was cancelled. Will not fly with them again.,0
"  Tokyo to Honolulu. I usually fly premium economy or business, if I'm lucky. I was terribly worried about this flight to and from Hawaii in the normal economy, but I was pleasantly surprised! They FA's were extremely cheerful and hard-working. The catering was adequate and delicious. The cabin kept very clean, including the toilets. The star of the show is the seats. My goodness, I'm a big person (183 cm tall and 230 kg), and even I was comfortable! I couldn't believe the legroom and the seat width of these wider seats. They are premium economy standard on many US airlines but extended to the entire economy class. On the downside, JAL is notorious for keeping the planes warm since Japanese are adverse to air conditioning and even air passing over their skin. I always take a fan to keep cool. Also, the AVOD is lacking. This is the one area they simply must improve upon. Oh, they offer wifi onboard, but it didn't work for me or my partner. It never prompted with a pay screen and it was not free.",1
"  London to Melbourne via Singapore. Average at best. Check in and baggage drop off hassle free. Lounge doesn’t have a great selection of food. As a gold velocity member with a third family member travelling on a different Star Alliance flight, she was refused entry despite gold membership allowing a guest, and travelling business class. I was met with 3 staff members who stuck to their guns. The lounge was quiet, but they assured me it would fill. I will never use this airline again.",0
"  The check in was excellent given the fact it was during the pandemic. Took off on time. The movies need to be updated more frequently. My food was a let down and portions are very small. From Singapore to Sydney ( 8+ hours) we were given one meal which included a rice noodles with seafood, ice cream and a bread roll. No salad or cheese and crackers. No pre arrival meal was given. No hot towels on both flights and my wifi never worked. However the staff were very polite and courteous. ",0
"  Istanbul to Vienna with an Airbus A321-200. The cabin was spacious and clean, the crew polite and helpful. Took off after a while due to heavy traffic over IST airport and the breakfast service started, for a 2 hours flight served an amazing breakfast with many drinks options and scrambled eggs were very tasty. A small IFE screen in front of me, but with a great selection of films or TV series, although I was too tired to watch something. Fast luggage delivery at the airport and very positive overall impression.",1
" London to Singapore. Dedicated first lounges at Heathrow, Singapore and also Hong Kong, unlike Emirates and Etihad that put first customers with business flyers at some airports. When your paying this much money it’s not acceptable. Amazing staff and food, especially book the cook. We had very turbulent flights and as a nervous flyer they couldn’t have been more caring. Absolutely not a bad thing to say about them apart from the fact that we weren’t on a A380 but 777 which is a horrible plane to fly. ",1
"  Emirates canceled tickets and did not propose anything on how to fly and did not make a full refund! If you use Emirates, you can stay without a ticket and without money. I had two tickets for this flight on 13 July. On 4 July, I was informed that Emirates had canceled the flight. I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded 188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service did not suggest this option for me.  I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me. ",0
"  One day before boarding I checked on their web site and it stated QR947 will have Qsuites which was not true actually it was one of the ex Cathay Pacific aircraft they bought to cover the shortage of equipment they are suffering from the A350 groundings. They did not have WiFI, the service was alright and don’t get me started with the catering it was inedible neither the appetizer nor the main course or the dreadful crumble dessert which has so much sugar to mask it’s shortcomings, the main course which was a prime rib was so over cooked and dry, the tapas was poor ingredients. The IFE was outdated that I had to revert to my iPad.",0
"  Riyadh to Manila via Istanbul. Both flights were excellent especially Istanbul to Manila. Food was plentiful & delicious. Generous seat pitch with 3x3x3 configuration on B777 which is necessary for this 12 hour flight. Average inflight entertainment which for me, who doesn't use it much is OK. This flight is full but the crew did excellent in their job.",1
"  In Brussels we were informed that the flight had 30 mins delay. In fact we left Brussels more than a full hour  late. The flight was denied landing in IST and deviated to Ankara. We missed our connection to Panamà. There was no concern, no information, no help at all for my partner and me and other passengers in similar situation. No excuse for the nuisance caused. Everything we had to find out by ourselves. No compensation was offered, like a drink or coffee or a place to rest. The attitude of staff at the desk was far below standard; e.g. someone asked our names and then left without saying a word and never coming back. Finally we were sent around half of the orbit and spent more than 70 hours in planes and airports - via Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires to Panamà- where we could catch our flight to Cartagena, unfortunately without our luggage, that was missing.",0
"  Taif to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. 8th June 2016 TIF to DOH A320 Excellent flight. No Business class seats so the leg was in First class. Catering excellent and service on board was second to none! The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan. This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat. Qatar always provides me with outstanding service and I love flying only with them if where I am going is one of their routes. Well done to all the staff who took care of me on this flight. Hats off to you!!",1
"  Although it was very early morning, things went fairly smooth. I was moved further up as they needed my seat for someone with medical problems which I was totally ok with. However the seat 19D armrest was falling apart. Food was very nice, and had a nice sleep. Perhaps on those early morning flights would be nice to have a choice (sticker) saying whether I want to be woken up for food or whether I want to be left sleeping. In terms of inflight entertainment it would be nice to be able to watch Rugby World cup",1
"  Emirates has been using the 777 to serve HKG ever since the start of the pandemic, it used to be the A380. The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still, one redeeming grace is that, they sell this short leg at a very attractive price, so that is acceptable.",1
"  New York to Singapore. We purchased the extra legroom seats for $120 per person/per flight. They are the worst seats ever. Yes, you get lots of legroom but you lose window, there are no windows at these seats, which is not told when you go onto the site to book, sleep, the lights never fully go out because you are right by the bathroom, plus you have the bathroom light shining in your face because no one ever closes the door, and you have to listen to the nonstop clicking of the bathroom door, your legroom, because people use your space to stand and stretch their legs and this is not monitored by the flight attendants. You are in the section with the crying babies, there is an actual section for babies. There is no storage space so you have to put all of your stuff in the overhead bin, and  you have to stow your tv during takeoff and landing so there is a good hour of just sitting there while everyone else is watching tv. I can’t believe we paid $500 for these terrible seats. If I had known I would have kept the cattle seats and stretched my legs on my way to the bathroom. Personally I think you should get a discount for sitting in these seats.",0
"  I found the cabin crew very professional, courteous, proactive, and without a doubt they clearly enjoyed their job. The meals served were most enjoyable and well presented. The flight of 7 and 13 hours soon passed without any problems, well worth it.",1
"  Flew Cathay Pacific Premium Economy from Sydney to Manila via Hong Kong. They changed the aircraft HKG-MNL in December but never contacted me to advise that there was now no Premium Economy cabin on this aircraft and instead I found out at check in. Ground crew advised I would receive a refund and compensation for this, just keep my boarding pass. CX Customer Service refunded me AUD$112 and did not even credit my FF account with premium points or status credits but at the much lower discounted economy rate. Funny I can not find a Premium fare that is only $112 more than an economy fare on the Cathay Pacific web site. I then filled in the complaint form online and there standard response ""Our team is currently reviewing your comments and, if necessary, one of our team members will contact you"" 14 days have passed and no contact from CX. Most appalling customer service and shameful for a premium airline. As a regular traveller Oneworld emerald for over 10 years now, goodbye CX.",0
"  We booked our flight from Toronto to Auckland on Cathay. Not an efficient route, but the fare was better than other routings and we have always appreciated the inflight service. Things went OK on the outbound flight although they rescheduled our flight several times. At least they notified us of the changes, Three days before our return flight, I went on line to check our departure time and there was a notice that our flights had been cancelled. They did not advise us, they did not try to rebook us. There was an option to click a button and request a refund only. In a panic, I called the NZ number on their website and got a message that the number was not in service. The only way I could communicate was a What’s App chat. After hours on this chat, the agent offered me a routing through New York which would get us home two days later than planned. Not great, but better than nothing. I said I would take it upon which she said it was not really available because the last leg was on American Airlines and they would need approval. She said my only option was to depart four days later on the original routing. I told her our visa expired on the original date and she said this was not Cathay’s problem. Mercifully, her shift ended and I got shunted to a new agent who was willing to try and get us on the JFK flight. She said I would have to wait for email confirmation. After an agonizing day of waiting for this confirmation, I went on line and saw that the American flight was confirmed but that the two Cathay flights were waitlisted! Back to the chat and more hours wasted to get all flights confirmed. I have never had a situation where an airline cancels your flight and that is the end of the story, I still cannot believe they did not advise us or try to rebook us without our intervention. We will never book with Cathay again as we have lost all confidence in this airline.",0
" Flew Air France from Shanghai to Paris CDG. The overall experience was quite pleasant, except for the old and outdated entertainment system on board. The movies are very outdated, the screen is very old and worked very slowly. However, we got a very good price for this flight so it's still very worth it.",1
"  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. This was my first long haul flight, which I did alone so I was very apprehensive about luggage being transferred, reaching connections in time and the flight in general. I was pretty happy with everything overall. The seats were comfy, I ended up with a window seat with two empty seats next to me, which was great. The entertainment system was brilliant. Lots to choose from. The wifi didn't work too well, but that wasn't an issue. The staff were very polite and helpful, blankets, wet towels, warm towels, pillows and headphones all supplied. The food wasn't amazing but wasn't an issue either. The only thing I wasn't impressed with were the ground staff at Dubai. No one was particularly helpful when I asked about my luggage being transferred. Apart from that I was very happy with Emirates and I will definitely use them on my next trip to Thailand.",1
"  Flight operated by Cityjet for Air France from Dublin to Paris CDG. Outbound generally OK though lounge lacks decent food to eat. On board good service but they served ham with no other option. Cabin crew were great though and tried to give me something else to eat. Return flight from Paris with chaotic boarding. I wonder why have priority boarding if you are just going to pack all of us in like sardines into a shuttle bus to get on the plane. Defeats the purpose of paying more for business class and having priority boarding. Lounge in terminal 2E was horrible. Hardly anything substantial to eat, not even bits of sandwiches! I did notice some pot noodles (in a business class lounge) and a passenger having to get information as to where to get hot water! On board though the service was impeccable. This time they had prawns and lovely orange juice and coffee. My luggage was also delivered very quickly at Dublin airport.",1
" Istanbul to Montreal. No WIFI on board! Internet connection was not working the whole 11 hours flight, attendants were lying to us saying that the connection was coming at first, then they said they had to reset the server then try in 2 minutes. I personnally chose this flight because of price and the internet feature.",0
"  Frankfurt - Toronto via Paris CDG. My first long-haul flight in pandemic. Air France took care of safety, handed out hygiene kits and staff payed attention that everyone is wearing a mask, so I felt safe while being onboard. All flights were on time and transfer at CDG airport was easy, only passport control took some time and boarding the flight to Toronto was a big chaos when all the documents were checked. Despite many bad reviews I think CDG is a good airport with attractive areas, great terminals, clear signage and helpful staff. Onboard experience on brand new A350 was pleasant, seats were comfortable and IFE was good with a lot of contents, but I didn`t like the selection of movies. A big plus was the free WIFI message pass, so I could send some whatsapp and pictures. The main meals on both flights were tasty with a free cup of Champagne. Snacks before landing were okay, but there were no alcoholic drinks with this second food service (cost cuttings or due to pandemic?). Otherwise AF offered free drinks (tea, coffee, juice, soft drinks and water) on short-haul flights between Paris and Frankfurt. Apart from some minor negative aspects this journey with Air France was very pleasant.",1
"  Maputo to Lahore via Doha. I flew more than 8 times on Qatar Airways and the service is very satisfactory. The crew is very kind respectful and supportive they answer every call and take care. The food on board is tasty,  on long fights they give amenity kit even in economy class as well. Doha Airport is world class and i Love it every time i am there, best in the World in my opinion.",1
"  Copenhagen to Dar es Salaam via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. For a couple of years I have flown quite a lot with this airline and I have been very satisfied with the service and performance, however recently it seems like the previous high standard is declining. The flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul was okay, but the journey from Istanbul to Dar Es Salaam was nothing to write home about - not something good at least. Mediocre meal, uninterested crew, fixed seat without any possibility for adjustments etc. I hope that Turkish Airlines will show it previous strength and performance on the way back. I will still recommend THY on this background.",1
"  I flew to Las Vegas in March 2016. From Manila, I had a layover in Seoul and then flew to Los Angeles. That was a 19 hour flight in total I think. I especially like their spacious legroom. They have excellent food quality. Korean Air's staff are all friendly and attentive to passengers needs. The only thing I didn't like was the clogged sink in the toilet. Overall, I would not hesitate to fly again with them.",1
"  Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018. It was genuinely a disappointing trip and  confirmed just how overrated Emirates is. On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu. ",0
"  CX 238. Left on time arrived slightly early, continuation of outward flight in Premium Economy. Seat 30A has no more room than the first row of economy, food is slightly better, films are exactly the same. Very full flight, is it worth 3x the price, having done both legs the answer is no. £1000 extra for a few inches and slightly better meal, simply too expensive.",1
"  ANA All Nippon Airways is the Best. We have traveled on many airlines around the world, but the service on ANA is the very best we have ever experienced. We want to call attention to the four flight attendants Aina, Seina, Ken, and Frame who served us on flight NH849 from Tokyo to Bangkok. All the attendants were great, but these four attendants were all exceptionally professional, hard-working, polite, and attentive. We appreciate all the extras, like the real silverware, selection of movies and the pillows and blankets. (We do wish, however, that there were a vegetarian food option for my wife.) We were only flying economy, but with service like this, they make ANA economy seem like First Class! ",1
"  My first flight post-pandemic and Singapore Airlines lived up to high expectations. The cabin crew were excellent and made regular drinks runs throughout the flight with trays of water, juice and sometimes beer. I was impressed by their professionalism, politeness and friendliness throughout the journey, despite having to serve almost a full flight. Flood (including snacks in between meals at the galley) was plentiful, even for economy class. Two free hours of wifi for economy class passengers was a welcome addition to the service. Everything went smoothly, from boarding to disembarking. Prior to the flight I had called the call centre to make a booking amendment and the service from the call centre was also efficient.",1
"  I have travelled with Qatar twice and it was such an amazing experience flying with them. I will never forget the flight from Bangalore to Doha and the services extended on that flight particularly from this cabin attendant called Akanksha she was the lead of the flight i assume, I am not comfortable flying and she made sure that I was comfortable, she is an epitome of how a professional should be, caring, attentive. I would like to thank the airline and their team for taking care of us.",1
"  Doha to Auckland. Early morning departure, ground staff were quite rude. Plane was 8 year old Boeing 777-200LR, quite old by Qatar Airways standards , but was very clean and fresh , on board service was impeccable. The IFE was a better selection than the one on the A350s and the meals were delicious I had the Sea Bass and the Arabic Breakfast. The long 17 hour flight went by like a breeze with the unbelievable high standards Qatar Airways deliver . The seats were very comfortable.",1
"  Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai.I am disappointed with Emirates. The entertainment is excellent, the food is good, the seat is comfortable, the aircraft is clean, the staff are okay. My flight from Paris to Dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. The ground staff at Paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. We landed at Dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. We need about 5-10 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. There were 2 staff holding boards, for the Bangkok flight passengers and other destination. We checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. All of the Kuala Lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate, just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. We were very shocked. If it had waited 10 more minutes, all of the passangers would not be stranded at the Dubai airport, on new years eve. We were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. My family got lucky. We got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. We were rerouted, flying from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Dhaka, using Bangladesh Airlines. We paid for Emirates, got Biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. Amazing way to start the year. I would be much grateful if the ground staff and the cabin staff had communicated better and at least some direction or guidance from the Emirates for the lost passengers. I would be happy to never fly with Emirates again.",0
"  Manila-Singapore-Manila Cabin is clean. Crew are kind and are visible throughout the flight. Ample seat space with generous reclining. Seat is built-in with adjustable lumbar support. Good selection of movies from Hollywood, Bollywood to Asian. Newspapers are available (e.g. Strait Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.). Food is great and is finished with Teh Tarik Ice Cream, SQ's 70th Anniversary gift to passengers. Toilet is clean and well-maintained. The flight is on-time. SQ (Silk) Singapore-KL-Singapore: This is just a short flight, approx. 45 min. Seats seems to be worn-out already but has generous space. The aircraft is clean. Entertainment is available through wi-fi but who needs one for a 45-minute flight. Newspapers are available (e.g. Strait Times, etc.) Friendly and generous crew. The flight is on-time.",1
" I have flown with them before and it used to be the best airlines where flight attendants were so warm and welcoming. Today I flew again with them and the all the interactions I had from check-in to my Flight attendant, everyone was just so passive aggressive. The seats are still nice with amazing space and amenities but the crew level has come down significantly.",0
"  Upon arrival at the airport for our trip from Brussels to Yogjakarta (Indonesia) it appeared that our flight was cancelled at the latest moment. We were told that a birdstrike was the cause but this is very questionable. After a waiting time of 8 hours at the airport in Brussels, Turkish Airlines were finally able to give us another route to Jakarta but not until our final destination of Yogjakarta. This forced us to book a hotel in Jakarta and a new flight to Yogjakarta. In the end we arrived 24 hours later at our destination Yogjakarta than originally foreseen. After our trip, we tried to claim the additional cost of €400 we had to pay ourselves (hotel cost + new flight cost to Yogjakarta). Despite being able to give all necessary documentation, Turkish Airlines refused to refund. We lost a full day of our trip but the airline was not able to give the little compensation we were asking. We will not be flying with Turkish Airlines anymore!",0
"  Turkish is one of the best airlines. When we arrived in Atlanta the check in was quick. Turkish does not provide TSA pre although I had it. When we got on the plane the seats were very comfortable and modern. The staff on the plane were very well trained and nice. The beverage they had for pre flight drinks were Cherry Juice, Orange Juice and, Lime juice. For eating options they had both American and Turkish eating options. On the ground I paid for a service that drove you in a buggy and passport control was smooth because I paid for the service. I was then taken from the airport to my hotel in a BMW.",1
"  Rome to Singapore. This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat. However, to convert to bed mode, you will need a flight attendant to pull down the seat back from the upright position. This is the main bugbear of the Business Class seat. No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits. As with other Singapore Airlines flights, the cabin crew were very polite, gracious and helpful and were able to anticipate passengers’ needs. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best in the category. Wifi was available on this flight. For business class passengers, the first 30 MB is free and after that you can purchase additional MB depending on your needs up to 200MB for US$ 25. The connection speed was reasonably fast - sufficient to upload a few Facebook photos.",1
"  Tokyo to Athens via Doha. The staff, the food, the free hygiene pack and the entertainment is excellent. I love everything about this airline and will definitely fly with them again. Great job Qatar Airways till next time.",1
"  Ground service at Tbilisi was good (by TAV) and boarding was okay and quite quick. Seats are comfortable in business for a 2 hour flight, although the armrest PTV's were not working. Strangely the cabin crew came and got these out so we could watch the safety video, but nothing was shown at all and staff seemed oblivious in the fact that nobody had been able to see the safety video! The breakfast was good and Do&Co food is the one strength that Turkish Airlines retains. Staff were reasonably efficient at serving and clearing the meal, but no real communication from them and they remained behind the closed curtain for most of the flight. Not a word from the Flight Deck at any point of the flight (departures, inflight or arrivals) and this is a real weakness on Turkish Airlines. They state that all aircraft and ""cleaned and disinfected"" between each flight, but sadly this is a very false statement - as a part of my work, I carried out 5 spot-check ATP tests in the seat / cabin area and all came back with a very big fail for cleanliness. After arrival, not a single passenger wanted to follow an orderly deplaning and there was just a mad rush and complete lack of social distancing. Overall an okay trip, but they have a lot to improve in their ambition to match some of the world's best airlines, and I am now very wary of their health and hygiene protocols.",0
"  I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical 'red eye' flight, and I'm at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a 'we don't care' kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft. I will be returning to Cebu to see my daughter at least two more times this year, but I will definitely not be flying SIA. I will revoke my KrisFlyer membership as well. I have flown budget airlines that are better than this. Buyer, beware! I would not recommend.",0
"  London to Guangzhou via Istanbul. I chose Turkish Airline on this occasion instead of my regular Qatar Airways. Was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turn out to be, flights were punctual, priority boarding at all sectors, attentive and smiling FAs plus a chef on board preparing food which was very tasty and flatbed seats on both aircraft. The only issue, nothing to do with the airline, is the last leg, Istanbul to London and it can be daunting especially after a 10 hour flight where you go through security checks twice and no laptops on hand baggage. Although flying Business Class, the queues is very much the same as travelling economy and it took forever. Apart from the security checks at IST, everything else was as good if not better than some other 5* airlines I have flown. Give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1
"  Prague to Sharm el Sheikh via Istanbul. Overbooked flights, missed flight because plane left earlier than scheduled (b/c was oversold) and they cancelled the return ticket, so we ended up paying triple for buying two new tickets because the operator did not care to tell us and did not care. Customer service is a nightmare, barely understandable English, very rude and don't care about the customers at all. Spoiled holiday.",0
" Flight from LHR to CDG was an unmemorable, standard intra European flight of 45 min. Despite this AF managed to serve a drink and a snack. CDG is a very confusing airport but we managed to find our departure gate. AF allows premium economy passengers to board via Sky Priority group 2. The seat is rather strange as it is a hard shell where the seat slides forward to recline. However I found my seat to be slightly broken so it did not recline as much as it should. My wife's seat next to me was in better condition, so she got full recline which looked comfortable. Generally the cabin looked very tired and in need of a refresh. The in-flight entertainment selection was not bad but limited compared with other airlines. The food was, on the other hand, very good. I would not have been disappointed to get the vegetable pasta in business class. The pre-landing snack, however, was probably the smallest tune sandwich I have ever seen. It was borderline a joke of a snack. The crew was friendly and attentive and they seemed well intended. We landed on time at DXB in the old terminal one but immigration and customs were quick and easy with no queues as we arrived at about 22:30. All in all not a bad flight, but not good value for money. This flight was not wifi enabled.",0
"  I can simply describe the whole experience as awful. Worst airline I have flown in 20 years. I am a Platinum Qantas FF and fly 1000s of miles every year. Long haul in business, short haul in economy. Check In - Awful. No Business Class signs, told to just ""push in front"" of a queue of at least 100 people trying to verify documents. Staff ignored requests for help and pretended not hear. Unorganised mess. Rude and aggressive ground staff, which defined the rest of the experience with staff. I was charged over weight of $250 euros. I reweighed what they claimed was 17kg in Manila, it was 10kg. It was a monitor that amazon had delivered ay 9.98kg. Same with my suitcase. If I had an option to walk away and get a refund I would have would have. I flew to Malta on Easyjet and they weighed the same bags and monitors at the weights I had got. I was not the only one being overcharged. MLA to IST - Awful. Lucky I took a few waters from the lounge. Offered a drink, never arrived. Cabin Crew spent whole flight hiding. Again they come across as rude and aggressive. The meal was beef fillet - burnt broccoli and a hamburger (that's what is looked and tasted like). One of the few positives the seats in the new 737 are good. 2 x 2 in business. Lounge Istanbul - Awful. Food was basically cakes. Not enough sitting space. Stocked up on water as expecting another painful leg. IST to MNL - Awful. Maybe I have been spoilt on Qatar A350. Maybe I was already annoyed but what a terrible product. Staff - I had to really bite my lip or I would have been incredibly rude. Just like they are. No menu, no drink offered, just super rude and aggressive staff. Ordering food was a challenge, ordering a drink impossible - would it not have been easier to get the menus, rather than describe the completely wrong products - ""some sort of beef thing"", it was lamb. Ordered a cabernet got a shiraz. Asked for water - nope. The seats -  I thought I was flying BA back 15 years ago. flat beds that go into a point so you can barely get your feet in. Super uncomfortable to sleep on, once offered to make my bed up, never came back. I was too scarred to ask due to the super aggressive rudeness of the staff. Everything was a chore. They huffed and puffed all the way through service. First meal (mezze) was goodish. Second was inedible, and I eat anything. Was never asked everything ok or shown any kind of care at all. I only flew Turkish as it was short lay over. I had flown them before the reverse route, side by side business seats where so much better. in flight chefs were great. I know there are restrictions currently but I flew Qatar not long ago SYD to MAN and what different experience. I flew EasyJet - better than this experience. its not the pandemic it is terrible, rude and aggressive staff - don't work in customer facing roles if you are this horrible. ",0
"  Brisbane to Moscow via Adelaide / Doha, and Qatar Airways is definitely one of the best airlines around. Its lounges are simply the best (especially with Krug Champagne) and the product is great for all classes. Ground staff is not often on par with flight attendants but I understand the standards are different. My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic. A321 flight with 100% occupancy are a little bit cramped, but for me Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines in the world, on par with Singapore Airlines",1
" New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable, clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.",0
"  London to Hong Kong. I have been flying this long haul route for some years, and often with Cathay, in fact this sector recently as well. I’ve never posted a review and never had cause for complaint before now. But something has recently gone very wrong with this previous exceptional airline. On boarding, even though I was on early, I wasn’t offered a drink and the staff seemed manically busy. But that’s not a biggie. After takeoff, the usual polite approach about meal choices - and this is where it all went wrong. The choices where limited (OK, it happens) and pretty dreadful. The ‘express’ option was either a vegetarian salad (OK, I’ll live with that as well) or soup (soup??). That’s it. So now I’m pressed for what I’m going to have for brunch (brunch? Where did brunch come from? Wasn’t mentioned on the last three same sectors I’ve done). I can’t describe the options as other than the omelette the words were unknown to me - I investigated further and found one that was fried turnips with some sort of porridge on top. No thanks, so I gave up. By the way, later on I was told that first class had cereals and croissants and toast - are you kidding me? So back to ‘dinner’. The vegetarian choice was a warm salad which sounded ok - and by the way, still haven’t been offered a drink which would have been nice. The ‘meal’ arrived with half a glass of red wine (which was good - disappeared quickly though), and wait for it. It was a sort of salad although you couldn’t see it as it as an orange foul smelling hot sauce had been poured on it. Disgusting. I politely handed it back, gave up and asked for the cheese. That appeared a little later - three water crackers, three grapes and two tiny wedges of cheese. Two and a half hours now passed - asked for a top up of wine. It never came, so I gave up, put my tray on the floor, drank some water and went to sleep. Six hours later, tried to get a tea, told the seat belt light was on and they couldn’t. Ok, I get that, but believe me, there was zero turbulence that anyone could possibly feel and the crew had disappeared. Got my fried turnips (sans porridge) and water at “brunch”, then when the bumps increased, off came the seat belt sign and I got a cup of tea and the chief of cabin crew got me a small croissant from first class! No, I’m not a whinger, yes, I understand safety and I know an airline when it’s losing the plot - sorry Cathay but I worked with you some years ago, have flown this route countless times, but we have choices now, and that was a shocker. What ever genius found your ‘chef’ and threw away the up and down the aisle service (forget the ipads - they take ages for the crew to work them out), get rid of him or her and go back to what you were doing less than 12 months ago - it worked.",0
"  Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline. I have been flying regularly since I was four years old and this was easily one of my best experiences – well up to the standard pioneered by the Middle East airlines.",1
"  Delhi to London via Doha. The return flight from DEL to DOH was uneventful, mainly due to the fact I slept most of the way. With a 3.45 departure I could not believe ear plugs had been removed from the wash bag to be replaced by a lip balm. In DOH I was told that even with a First ticket you could not take a guest with you, even though he was on a business ticket. A380 back to LHR, the difference between Qatar’s business and first is the seat. The cabin was spacious and the seat did make a comfortable bed, but no pjamas offered and no mattress cover, only a meager thin blanket con this daytime flight. Food was the same as business , nothing special. Free wifi provided was very patchy. Took a trip to the bar to see it as had been told was worth a look, and it was but very busy, so retreated back to my seat. Crew on this flight were a delight, CSD was professional but friendly and the other crew were a joy! Much better standard than on the way out. Personally I don’t think first class is worth the price with Qatar difference with in business.",1
"  I fly with Qatar Airways every month. Credit where credit is due they are by far the best airline in the world. Staff are excellent, tentative onboard and at checkin. The seating is very spacious, food is of a high standard and inflight entertainment excellent. You can’t ask for anymore from an airline. I’m in the T4 frequent flyer lounge at Heathrow and WOW Thank you",1
" Flight hostesses didn't acknowledge or greet me as I walked to get seated. There are 2-3 hostesses standing by their assigned section who don't acknowledge or greet you, and if they do it's forced and fake. They give juice/water and if you return it when they come to collect it and you say ""thank you"" they didn't acknowledge. ",0
"  Stuttgart to Toronto via Paris. Included in the bill for the fare was the reservation fee for 2 seats. When my passport data was requested in the week before the flight, one of the seats was not listed anymore. I had to book that seat and pay again by phone but was assured to get a refund. Starting in November 2016, I repeatedly applied for this refund, adding proof of confirmation and payments. Until today, these proofs have been ignored and a refund denied stating that no booking or can be found and the payments were correct. In addition, my connecting flight from Toronto to London was cancelled due to bad weather and, unless I wanted to spend the night in Toronto at my own expense, I joined with 2 other stranded passengers to rent a car to get to London. Although I booked and paid the flight with Air France, it referred me to Air Canada which denied my request for compensation and a refund of that leg of the flight. Air France totally ignored my request for a refund and, of course, also denied compensation.

"  Manchester to Dubai. First time flying with Emirates for 10 years. Booked seats 11J/K which are the last row before economy section. Seats were a little bit hard, seemed to have little padding on the cushion. Legroom was OK but I could not get really comfortable in the seat. One major annoyance was the removable tablet on the seat frame which got in the way of my left arm and which restricted movement. The food service was good but the wine list is restricted when compared to Qatar Airways. The inflight entertainment was good but a bit fiddly to operate. Cabin crew were generally good and plane was clean and tidy. Overall a good flight but not as good as I was expecting.",1
"  Dammam to Istanbul. The staff were kind and the seats were comfortable for a 4 hour flight in economy class, the in-flight entertainment system was amazing, but there was a problem which is that sometimes the IFE glitches. They served us a meal but they used to give us bread with the meal, I don't know what happened. Overall, the airline is good for medium-haul flights.",1
"   When I traveled from Düsseldorf to Ankara with Anadolujet, my suitcase arrived broken. I filed a damage report at the airport. Even though I have sent e-mails many times and submitted all the documents requested through the THY Baggage Services portal, along with photographs showing the damage, I have not received any response for 3 months. I see on the THY Baggage services portal that my file has been transferred to the compensation unit, but I cannot receive any response.",0
"  Tehran to Paris via Doha. I had flown with Qatar Airways 4-5 years ago two times and I believe their food quality and service was much better. This time, I received quite same I was offered on my initial leg of my flight and the quality was not as expected. When I requested for extra bread they refused the request. The staff didn't behave patiently enough. I'm comparing with my previous experience flying with Qatar Airways.",1
"  Bangkok to London. This is my 6th flight to Thailand with Eva. I no longer bother with Premium Economy as the Economy class is a very good product. Although the aircraft was over 10 years old it was smart and spotless, everything worked. The food and staff were excellent. Eva was a delight. Spacious, clean, all full service amenities offered down to a toothbrush & toothpaste.  The staff were great which altogether made for a very pleasant 12 hour journey.",1
"  Everything was fine for this return flight from Cayenne to Paris Orly. Aircraft on time, check in procedures OK immigration queue less than 3 minutes. We were about to embark the plane when the captain told us the aircraft was unserviceable due to technical problem. Instead of a departure on Thursday at 17:25, we took off on Saturday 02:00. Ground staff took us in charge very professionally and less than 3 hours after the captain announcement, we were at the hotel bar with nights and meals took in charge by Air France and we had new flight reservations. The flight was quiet (Take off at 0200 AM) with good inflight service.",1
" Flight from Hong Kong to Amsterdam on Cathay Pacific in Business Class. Cathay has reverse herringbone seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. I found the seat to be very comfortable for sleeping. In particular, I had plenty of space for my feet and legs. Furthermore, there was adequate storage available. The service was very attentive, and the quality of the food was decent, however, it could have been slightly more in terms of quantity. Nevertheless, if the price is right, I would happily choose Cathay Pacific again.",1
"  London Gatwick to Istanbul via Dubai. My daughter's birthday was on the day we flew out from London Gatwick and I phoned them in advance to let them know this. They informed me to sign up to their 'Miles & Miles' membership so that they can provide a cake to my daughter in the plane. I did what was asked for but no cake or anything special. The aircraft was small from London to Istanbul, however the aircraft from Istanbul to Dubai was slightly bigger. I would have thought they would had bigger and better planes as London is a more international city but I was wrong. The customer service from stewards was poor. They did not smile and the level of English was inadequate as they could not answer basic questions i.e do you herbal tea. Equally, the food was terrible and tasteless. We were given something like toast. They should stick to traditional food like bulgar with kofta or shawarma. This would have been better. On the plus side. Entertainment system was good and had good choice of movies etc including Turkish TV series 'Ertugrul'. On the way back to London my daughter's TV entertainment system did not work which was disappointing. Economy class seats were okay but nothing that special. Long way for Turkish airlines to go before they become an international class carrier. Would not fly again nor recommend it to anyone.",0
"  Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset.  The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad.  For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food. These were sale flights I booked and I don't know whether I would fly them again.",1
"  Amsterdam to Bangalore via Dubai. Until now I have always enjoyed flying Emirates. Real quality however proves itself when things go wrong. And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked, replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works (Emirates knew this before), we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help, for instance helping to find a hotel, a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had pre-booked a dietary request: Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint, some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude, in general Emirates is excellent, but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner. Disappointing and I do not know if I would recommend them.",1
"  Flew JFK-FRA-SIN vv on SQ25/26 on Premium Economy. Great value overall with airfare at $1000 RT. JFK facilities are subpar in T4 for premium airline - boarding was chaotic with roughly six separate lines outside main gate to handle the double decker flight. Prem Economy cabin was nice and clean, nice orange/grey color scheme. Blanket and pillow on seat, along with with noise cancelling headphones. Amenity kit upon request containing socks, dental kit. Eyemask upon request. Nice pitch, calf support and generous recline for Economy. Meals were on the smaller side, only difference with the back I believe is an extra choice and champagne on plastic cups. Was able to prebook meal using Book the Cook which is a nice feature for Premium Economy. JFK-FRA cabin crew much friendlier than FRA-SIN, but still the trademark SQ service throughout. Krisworld has a great selection of movies and TV- the add playlist is pretty nifty and easy to use. Transfer at FRA was 90min, no fuss, no security. Arrival in SQ was easy and quick. Check in on return flight was great, T3 of Changi is very nice. Return flight was non-eventful. Excellent service particularly on FRA-JFK sector (less full) whereas out of SIN was packed. Great experience overall. Would definitely recommend the PremEcon if you keep the fare to less than $1200. Not sure if the value is there if you pay for much more.",1
"  Qatar Airways has become my preferred airline.  They make you feel welcomed at all times. During the pandemic and in times like this, they make us feel safe. They keep on ensuring all health and safety requirements are met. What stood out during my recent trip were 2 main things. When confirming my meal preference, I was greeted by “Welcome Back” and that just made me feel recognized. They know their customers well and never miss out on any meal preference requested or any detail that could make you feel comfortable. We had arrived slightly late to Doha and I didn't have much time left to catch my second flight. But qatar airways ensured that everyone going on a connected flight was escorted to their next gate and on time. The attention to the small details have made Qatar Airways stand out by far and that is what counts.",1
"  Tokyo to Dubai. First time traveling on the A380 and it was excellent. Spacious, comfortable and huge amounts of storage space. Attentive but unobtrusive service from friendly crew. Had ordered the vegan meal so received the now somewhat expected ratatouille and fried potato cubes which was a little underwhelming. The next meal that arrived (breakfast?) was a huge serving of lentils and more ratatouille so I decided to give that a miss and just take advantage of the pastries that were offered round instead. Managed to sleep for a decent amount of time on this flight so arrived feeling fresh and rested. A great flight and great service but my food option could perhaps have been a little better.",1
" London to Doha. This was my return portion of my trip so my flight was a BA flight number and I truly enjoyed the A380 experience. Even though the product was dated as it is the only aircraft type that Qatar Airways has first class on, but even business class is the old product but it doesn’t mean it is not good - it is better than most of the competition. The Wi-Fi was very slow and I did not use the entertainment system. The food was the best tasting and presentation I have ever had on any flight I have taken since I started flying in the early 1970s especially the scallops and ossobuco. The Caviar was more on the cheaper Sevruga type and the strawberry pie was masked with too much sugar to give your taste buds a chance to see it’s quality but to put an item on the menu as “Qatari grown chicken“ does not do any positive advertising for the country because it does not show these chicken are free range or organic fed or even antibiotic free - that issue has to be addressed sooner rather than later. The cabin staff were excellent.",1
"  London to Dammam via Dubai. I am a regular traveler with Emirates due to business, I have noticed a decline in cabin standards over the past year. On this particular trip I requested Lactose free meal, the cabin crew gave me a meal that did not have my seat number. I advised what I had requested and was told you can eat it as it is just a sandwich, when I inquired what was in it they did not know.",0
" Flew TK 5 / 22 MAR, Istanbul - Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML (Asian vegetarian Meal). TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.",0
"  Munich to Adelaide via Dubai. The first flight from Munich to Dubai was excellent. Traveling alone with my 10 month old son, the cabin crew were amazing. Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience. Food was ok (no infant meal provided) but ran out of salmon so only turkey available in 2nd meal service. Ticket was cheapest option for route but customer service needs a massive review for greater consistency across all flights.",1
"  Thank you so much for taking us home today. After month being stuck due to Covid19 in a foreign country and having very bad experiences with 2 other airlines (one from Germany and one from Iceland) selling tickets for flights they never really planned to fly just to get fresh money in,we had this great experience with QatarAirways. A Reliable service, free date change of our tickets, outstanding service over the phone, on the app and in person, everybody so helpful, professional safety measures... Full 5 Stars in every aspect. You definitely made 2 new customers. ",1
 Paris CDG to Los Angeles. The worst flight I have ever been on in my entire life. We were given one meal at the start of our 11 hour flight about 1 hour in to the flight. The staff then provided nothing in the way of drinks or snacks for the next 9 hours. It was inhumane. No one should fly with this company and force them all to close.,0
" Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted.",0
  Paris to Singapore. A very good experience from the lounge to the landing. Easy access to the lounge and it’s spacious and clean shower. The boarding was great. The seat is very comfortable with lots of privacy. The selection of food just magnificent The wine and cognac excellent. Great inflight service. The staff was extremely nice and helpful.,1
"  Hong Kong to Melbourne. I am writing to complain about the terrible experience that I had on this flight. The seats were more cramped than China Southern Airlines, with which I have flown in the past.  The staff only spoke English and not Mandarin Chinese, despite the flight being full of Chinese people. The flight was delayed on the tarmac for three hours, while a fault was investigated. During this time all passengers were crammed into their seats and forced to wait. No food was provided. The cabin was redolent with the smell of aviation gas. Surely it would have been better to let people alight the aircraft while the fault was fixed. The Cathay Pacific brand used to carry some air of quality and distinction in my mind, but no more! Now I consider it to be a cheap junk budget airline that does nothing but disappoint. We will not be flying with Cathay Pacific again, and we will tell all our friends not to as well.",0
"  Kathmandu to Gatwick via Dubai. Emirates are mis selling these flights. The Kathmandu to Dubai leg is with FlyDubai, their budget airline. No mention is made of this when booking the tickets. The flight between Dubai and Gatwick was great as you would expect and the FlyDubai was fine for a budget airline BUT I didnt realise I was booking a budget airline. It's in a totally different terminal with minimal facilities and you need to allow 1 hour to transfer. If I was only travelling between Dubai and Kathmandu fine but I had a 5 hour wait in a sparse terminal after an overnight flight. Then was on a budget flight, no offer of even water until we were 1 hour into the flight. No problem with budget airlines if its what I choose but I and everyone I spoke to about the second flight felt we'd been tricked by Emirates.",0
"  Smooth flight experiences on both ways from Zurich to Doha with Qatar Airways. Excellent business class layout and seats. Superb food and wine list. Only negative was that the screens on my seats were not touch screens and the navigation with the handset was a little difficult, because the touch screen there was to small for my fingers.",1
"  The flight from Islamabad to Doha was full, lots of hand luggage. The crew barked orders at the passengers and stuffed the overhead bins with anything that would fit. On the flight to Tokyo, I had a row to myself and a very attentive and friendly crew, similar to other experiences I have with the airline. There was a scheduled 21h layover in Doha, but the airline stopped their offer for a hotel room for such long stays. If I hadn't inquired, I wouldn't have been told about the 1 meal voucher they offer. Everything except the food court is overpriced at that airport.",1
"  Tokyo Narita to Singapore. Excellent inflight service. Food is good. Beverage selection is good and I love their cocktail, especially the Bailey White Russian. The aircraft seem a bit old and the IFE screen is really bad, really dark and difficult to watch to movie, earphone provided is also uncomfortable and sound quality is really bad.",1
"  Best ever experience, the cabin crew and service are exceptional. Everything super clean, food was OK. Previously I flew in Business Class so I have some comparison - generally best value for the money.",1
  Singapore to Perth. The Singapore Airlines Boeing 787-10 is a first class plane and comes with excellent and attentive service from the cabin crew. Very modern Kris entertainment system. Food acceptable but not fantastic. Suggest they provide headsets rather than the earpiece variety which are hopeless.,1
"  Bangkok to Seoul. A330 Outbound on time, return A380 30 mins late departing. Both planes clean. crew attentive and smart appearance. Food excellent and choice of three main courses; fish on return not served warm enough (below 60c). IFE okay; reasonable choice but not extensive so being marketed as 'Beyond Entertainment' is somewhat misleading. Delay in accepting commands on screen is annoying. Advertisement for Winter Olympics prior to every show or film gets repetitive; Korean Air should proof watch this 50 times to see what their passengers put up with. Overall good value for money. A380 return too hot in economy.",1
"  Barcelona to Jakarta via Dubai. Emirates online and ground services got it wrong all the way. Going from Barcelona to Jakarta we had planned a stopover in Dubai, we had an hotel for the night and the second flight the day after. So we could travel in eco without being too tired. Unfortunately for us Emirates messed up multiple times. The flight was delayed, that might be a normal safety measure. But then we got no information or wrong information all the way. It’s a wrong strategy to do so with Emirates, as they can mess up your trip fully, and won’t give you more than a poor meal (free poor meal). They can tell you that you will get refunded for your additional expenses and then decline later. All the way to Jakarta, we asked to sleep in Dubai, in Emirates lounge maybe? Explaining we were losing our hotel. The day of departure, after delay notification: Support chat: “I don’t know”. Emirates Barcelona ground service: “I can’t give you anything in Dubai, you should ask there. But you will get the 600 euros indemnity each for severe delay, it should cover all your expenses, in case anyway.""  At Emirates Dubai ground service: “Hi, can we sleep somewhere? We are really tired? - Here is your meal voucher. - But we would like to sleep, we are tired, we are not hungry, really. Can we go to the lounge, maybe? - Yeah.. maybe, try there, here is your meal voucher”. We needed to sleep, we paid the hotel in the airport, around 200 USD. We do the online complaint to Emirates. Emirates feedback: “In accordance with the EC regulation 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, you are entitled to EUR 600.00 (Euros Six Hundred only) each.” We fill the form for funds transfer, as requested 7. Emirates feedback: Sorry, my bad, you get nothing because you arrived at your final destination on time.",0
"  San Francisco to Paris. I have a rather good time flying Air France. The food is above average in coach and FAs are almost always polite, friendly and helpful. The seats are nicely designed and allow for decent leg space and the cup holder is a really nice addition. Lots of people dislike Air France because of their CDG hub but I’ve never had a particular problem there and find it more organized than most US airports I’ve been to. If you get to choose, do avoid the A380 though, as the coach cabin hasn’t been refurbished on those yet.",1
  Singapore to Bangkok. Aircraft was in perfect condition and clean despite one lavatory being unserviceable. Both ground and cabin staff were coordinated both boarding and arrival was Done in a smooth flow. The food was perfectly prepared and was the best economy meal I had. I recommend SIA and hope to fly with them again soon.,1
" After arriving via an A380 and a really unpleasant transit of CDG, we connected with our flight to Barcelona on an Air France A320. This is quite a contrast with regard to business class seating which on the A320 has the same pitch as economy class with the middle seat in a row of three left unoccupied. Seating felt cramped despite the supposed 32"" seat pitch - it felt tighter than that. Seat width was fine. While being less roomy, the Air France business class in Europe does provide a much nicer food service than typically provided on flights in the United States. On United on a two hour flight I received coffee and a muffin. On American on a two hour flight I received some warm nuts and a cookie. Air France, on a one hour, twenty minute flight, provided a full meal - shrimp appetizer, mini burger, grilled vegetables, hazelnut cake, panna cotta and beverages. Quite a different experience. Service was pleasant and professional. I would have preferred a bit more space but the experience with Air France was fine.",1
"  I flew from Stockholm Arlanda to Singapore Changi via Doha, in economy class. The first flight was nothing less than expected from Qatar Airways. The inflight service was very good, seats were OK, staff were quite courteous. The flight departed on time and landed a few minutes before schedule. The inflight entertainment in this particular aircraft was a bit dated, but worked nonetheless. Transfer in Doha was quick, no queuing in the security check. The A350-900 was a bit more comfortable than the B787, and the inflight entertainment was newer in this aircraft. WiFi was not free, and the price was very high, which is a big minus. The tickets were very cheap, and I'd say you get a lot for your money. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",1
 New York to Hong Kong. Started with a moody ground crew at JFK during check in. More comfortable flight with longer leg room and slightly bigger in width seat. However Halal food was disappointing. Was given a vegetarian breakfast. Dinner was bland rice with curry chicken and black beans. Food reminds me of army camp food. We were hungry during the long flight. Halal food ia not vegeterian food. I envy other passengers having nice meat in their meal. Staff were helpful and friendly but I felt should have offered more drinks and snacks.,1
"  What excellent flights from New York to Taipei return. I flew out on Christmas Day 2016 and returned on 13 January 2017. This was the first time we took EVA Air and tried out their Elite Class (premium economy). I used to take either premium economy or business with Cathay Pacific. As I was not happy with the service of CX I decided to try EVA Air which received good reviews and offered cheaper tickets. I am so glad I did! The planes were new, which made a lot of difference for air quality on a long-haul flight. The seats were much more comfortable than that of Cathay Pacific Premium Economy. They were wider and could lean back much more. There were plenty of flight attendents who responded to requests promptly and always with a smile. They also kept the toilets clean and well-supplied throughout the long flight. The food choice was excellent, and meals were tasty. The service was top-notch. All attendants were polite and attentive. I had a slight stomach problem when flying back. The nice attendant noticed that I skipped meals. She cared enough to ask me if I was feeling better and would I like a sandwich to bring home. This is the kind of service that wins hearts. Bravo EVA Air. ",1
"  Gatwick to Hurghada via Istanbul. Absolutely the worst experience. Avoid them at all costs. The initial flight was delayed for no obvious reason at Gatwick for two hours and half the plane had connecting flights with a 2 hour stop over. We managed to make up some time during the flight so the pilot drove round the airport a few times (yes we did all see you drive past the same building 3 times) deliberately making us miss our connections. We felt they had overbooked so did this on purpose. The next available flight was 24 hours so as a solo female traveller I was forced to stay in a hotel I felt very unsafe in in an extremely rough part of Istanbul booked by the airline. Checked in and was sent to a room where there already a naked man occupying it and in the shower (again not a great situation for either of us). Went to dinner in the hotel and was the only western female surround by around 30 Turkish men staring and making comments. Spend the next 24 hours in my room feeling anxious. Got the bus laid on by the airline back to the airport and the engine blew up on the motorway, driver got off, engine was smoking and said nothing to worry about! Why are we on here and you are not then? Finally got another bus and managed to make it to Hurghada 27 hours late. Air line should be renamed fawlty airlines.",0
"  The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.",0
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Dhaka to Larnaca via Doha. Service has definitely improved on Dhaka routes! Check-in process at the counter also improved at Dhaka airport. Inflight food and service were great, staff were amazing. For the vegetarian food, it always seems that on board vegetarian options are always much better than the pre-order ones, lacto-vegi here! Inflight entertainment, was ok but not that many good options, Tedtalks were good. For this routes some music from Tagore classics would be great on flights. Overall great service.",1
"  Tokyo to New York. Absolute worst customer service and experience with this Airline. On my honeymoon and paid for an upgrade on the way to my destination and halfway was downgraded. They blamed JFK for not properly communicating the upgrade was only halfway. Either way we got the runaround with a few different people at the Haneda Airport. Most notably was an incredibly rude manager, I was shocked when she said she was a manager because the way she spoke and handled this was incredibly unprofessional. I was interrupted nonstop by “no no solution unless you pay more”. Horrible experience I will never fly with this Airline again. Don’t use them if you want to avoid the worst headache and rude customer service. I would give zero stars if I could.",0
" Flew Southampton to Dubai via Paris CDG. Our first long haul flight with Air France we chose their business class over BA Club world even though it meant changing aircraft. The whole experience was excellent. I lost my computer in Paris and the ground crew amazingly found it and bought it to the lounge for me. Lounge in hall L 2 F was brand new and excellent. Slight delay caused by heavy snow. On board was new business cabin, really comfortable seat. Food exquisite and beverages all good. Cabin crew all excellent. Can not fault them.",1
"  Yangon to Tokyo. There was a storm in the South China Sea. You'd think that when the flight is cancelled, they'd at least shoot an email to the customers. They did nothing. We went to the airport and was informed that the flight is cancelled. To be fair they did pay decent compensations for hotel and transportation.",0
"  Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul.",1
" Milan to New York and Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. I've been flying with Emirates for the last 3 years during holidays. I have flown several times both in Economy and Business Class. I have flown in Business Class both on the Airbus A380-800 and the Boeing 777-300ER. Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking. In Economy Class, you also have the possibility to see the menu and they pass with drinks many many times.",1
  Colombo to London via Doha. The sector from Doha to London was flawless on an A380-800. The flight took off and arrived on time. In-flight services were very good. The seating was 3x4x3 and there were plenty of toilets. The flight attendants were attentive without being overwhelming. Altogether a good flight. The Colombo to Doha sector on an A340 with 2x4x2 seat configuration had a few problems. Although I had checked in online I had to join the queue to drop my bag off. I could not see the point of checking-in online. The check-in/bag drop girl spoke in phrases and not in sentences. Boarding was rather chaotic but I presume that this is mostly to do with the airport staff at Colombo. The flight departed 1 hour and 10 minutes late after boarding and because of a thunderstorm. CMB-DOH sector not good but DOH-LHR sector was very good.,1
"  Ankara to Dalaman. No problem or hassle on the ground. Promptly departed and landed. Seat pitch was quite bad, uncomfortable seating. No problems with the cabin crew. Flights to and from Dalaman are usually problematic during summer, October is just sublime. To my surprise, the flight was full. Turkish offers a sandwich, soft drink and water for an hour flight. Overall, it was a satisfactory flight.",1
"  The early evening flight was a new A380. Food wasn't anything exceptional though but I should mention that Singapore airlines does go through excessive lengths even in economy class, for instance providing menus. The biggest let down was the breakfast with a cold muffin and some fruits which isn't what I expected on a flagship route because I have eaten better meals on short haul flights with SQ. Crew were varying. The ones that greeted us at the entrance were extremely pleasant but the ones in the rear economy class section were very serious and I saw barely any smiling. Still got the job done though. Inflight entertainment is out of this world and is extremely sophisticated and can keep you entertained for the full 8 hours.",1
"  Red eye flight from Haneda to Bangkok with Japan Airlines. Boarding was speedy and efficient. After take-off, light snack, bread, and drinks were offered. A bottle of mineral water was offered to each passenger too. However, unlike other carriers, the flight attendants did not go around with drinks. There was only one choice for breakfast but it was great.",1
" I used to fly Cathay Pacific Business between Europe and Asia (and was disappointed with the service) but had to fly Premium Economy this time due to the high price during holiday season. Overall I think it represents better value than business class. Check in at London Heathrow was fully automatic - you have to print out the boarding pass, luggage tag and attached it to your bag and drop it using a machine. Not an issue here. Boarding was smooth and easy and we took off on time. Hot towel and welcome drink were provided. I was able to secure the first row of the cabin and found the leg room much better than other seats in PE. However the screen is stored below the arm rest so if you plan to watch a lot of movie or have gate to gate entertainment this is the row to avoid. The A350 used for Hong Kong to Taipei sector is far superior than the B777 for long haul. I found the food and service ok - given the fact that it was sub standard in business class. One thing I don't appreciate is unlike EVA which I often fly with, the toilets were not regularly cleaned. I also found the selection of movies poor. When I booked my Premium Economy ticket I was inform that the flight from Hong Kong to Taipei would be operated by A330 without PE so I was allocated a seat in economy. When I arrived at the gate I spotted that it was changed to A350 with PE and check with the ground staff if it is possible to get a seat in PE. I was told that the airplane was still an A330 and there was no PE available - that proved to be totally wrong.",1
" Very good flights with Air France, both from Dublin to Paris and Paris to Sao Paulo. Small delay on long flight but they made it up on arrival to Sao Paulo. Airline staff very good and attentive during this very full 11+ flight. IFE was quite good and new content had been added since my last flight to the US, which was appreciated, as on previous trips, they hadn't added too many. But they seem to be taking advice from their customers with new content more regular.",1
"  Phuket to Dubai. Aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. There was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. Eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal, both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. Discounting the delay, I was not overly impressed with Emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.",0
  Montreal to Istanbul. I had my worst travelling experience in my life. They lost my luggage for 3 days. They did not give right information on the phone and they did not compensate the expenses due to the delay completely. The ticket price was more expensive than the other airlines and the provided services was disaster.,0
" Doha to New York. Very bad. The food was horrible. The bathroom was so dirty. The whole time the aircraft was smelling. I requested to change my seat, they didn’t do it. I never will use Qatar Airways. I don’t recommenced to anyone .",0
  My first two sector business review of Turkish. They have restarted mostly a full service which to fair is good. Amenity kits back on offer which reassured me that it’s not all cutting corners to save money. Flights mostly busy due to restrictions with other airlines at present into London. Crew attentive and a full selection of alcoholic drinks. I don’t use IFE but it looked pretty good. Summing up even if their business product is generally lacklustre and basic (think 1990s) it was economical and would try again if there were no ME3 alternatives.,1
"  Cebu to Hong Kong. Checked-in online, so we didnt have to go to the check in counters, but in another counter to print the boarding pass. The aircraft was quite old but the interior was fresh. The seats were very spacious. The entertainment system had lots of movies, but it didnt match my preferences. After takeoff, lunch was served, but it was a bit too slow, just about 1 hour and 30 minutes after takeoff, we were now served our meals. My meal was chicken with rice and ocra. I dont like ocra so I wasn't able to taste it, but the rice and chicken, very delicious. The flight had sone light turbulence. All in all, a very pleasant flight.",1
" Departure in Brussels was delayed, something which is not uncommon with Turkish Airlines and as a result we were going to miss our connecting flight. Luckily, the connecting flight was also delayed so we had approximately 30-45min from landing to reach the gate and still get our connecting flight. However, rather than helping us to reach the connection flight in time, Turkish Airlines delayed our de-boarding from the aircraft and when we could finally step out of the aircraft we were brought with a bus to the gate at the exact opposite of where our connecting flight was departing from. Requests for assistance were made and while all of this happened in Istanbul (home base of Turkish Airlines), nothing was done or even suggested to help with the result that we missed our connecting flight with 10 minutes. Following this the difficulties started to get a new flight for which we had to wait 24 hours, a hotel was luckily provided but by the time we arrived in the hotel it was 6am another 4 hours later. When requesting compensation as per the EC regulations, Turkish Airlines refuses to adhere to its obligations.",0
"  Fort de France to Amsterdam via Paris. Hands down the worst experience I have had.The plane looks like it flew right from the 80s with seats that were super old and uncomfortable. The entertainment system is also at least 20 years old - it's also malfunctioning. Useless entertainment of terrible quality so I just turned it off. Then at the end of the flight, where I did not sleep (I usually do and this time I even took a sleeping pill), we got the worst breakfast.  The flight is a connecting flight through Paris, but you have to take a bus to from orly to Charles de Gaulle which. This is terrible by itself but it becomes much worse when you have no clue what to do and have to pick up tickets on your own somewhere else, then we had to wait for almost an hour for the bus to CDG! Almost missing our connecting flight, stressful and ridiculous the way this is organised. Also, somehow the French staff seem too arrogant to speak English, which is something they should do if your are flying an international crowd. If it is not needed, I'm never going to fly air France again.",0
" Tokyo to London Heathrow. One of the best airlines I've flown with. Clean aircraft, very good food and cabin crew at your service, making sure you are comfortable and don’t need anything. And I was in Eco class. I had the chance to chat with the crew during the flight, attitude free, very simple, but sharply professional. The inflight entertainment can be improved but the essentials were there. The flight was slightly delayed but the crew on the ground kept constatant communication and we ended up landed early. I will definitely fly again with JAL.",1
  Flew from Doha to London Heathrow. Qatar Airways Business Class on the A380 is one of the best I have been on. The seat is spacious with plenty of storage. The menu had a very good choice of main meals and also something vegetarian. The bar at the back of Business Class has an airy feel to it. I travelled with my husband and we decided to have the two seats in the middle. He is a terrible traveller but he managed to sleep for 5 hours and felt very refreshed when we got to London. We had a 4-hour layover in Doha and their Business Class lounge is also very good which makes the long flight with stopover much more pleasurable.,1
"   Always excellent! Service, friendliness, comfort and quality all top. Pre-orderd food worked this time and i got a juice steak. Wine list excellent. The wines could be taken out and get room temperature after take off so when served not ics cold as now. WiFi should be free for the fairs charged in business class!",1
"  Dubai to Stockholm. Excellent check in at DXB,  separated from Economy class passengers.  Business lounge in DXB has really poor offers for breakfast. Disappointed. Boarding not great. Business class passengers have to give priority to economy class. Strongly recommend Emirates to change policy. I felt the seat is narrow (2x3x2 seating in business class). No such experiences with CX, SQ, LH, BA or SK. Extensive film and CD selection, but the info and guidance (for choosing films) in the paper Magazine were irrelevant. Hence, ended up listening to Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Strongly recommend Emirates to present the films in a better way. For lunch there was a selection and obviously made I the wrong choice. Cannot blame Emirates but other passengers are recommended to make safer bets.",0
"  Initially my flight got cancelled and my transit time was 1 hour and a few minutes. They gave me a new flight with a transit of 14 hours.  On arrival to Doha, I had paid for a lounge when purchasing my ticket that gives me access to 6hours of the lounge. I had to pay another 55 USD so I can stay till my flight time. I will not be flying this airline in the future.",0
"  I had a flight from Bangkok to Paris (France) via Dubai. The transit was supposed to last 1h 30. With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours. We finally reached Paris the day after. Fortunately we could spend the night in a hotel. And we could get the final flight the day after, where all the blankets were gathered in front of emergency doors. And of course with a delay. Emirates, never again.",0
"  Washington to Istanbul. Just don’t fly Turkish Airlines or you will receive the worst flying experience, ever. Make sure to check out their reviews online before you buy a ticket from them.  Dealing with Turkish Airlines is a nightmare. They have very poor customer service, the employees are very rude, ""unfriendly and unprofessional"". They seem to have a “no smile” policy. They will not listen to your needs and ignore your complaints. They will not take responsibility or apologize to make up for your losses when they screw up. I do not recommend using Turkish Airlines.  I flew with them 25 years ago and had a bad experience back then. I had hoped that they had improved their services since then, but instead it went from bad to worse.",0
"  Stockholm to Singapore and onwards to Phuket. We booked 5 seats in a row, 3 on the left side and the next 2 seats in the middle. Flying economy, our expectations were fairly low, but we were pleasantly surprised by the seats. The legroom was large, the seats were decently comfortable and in-flight entertainment system was excellent. Before taking off, the crew handed out hot towels and the menu, which was very nice. Shortly after take-off, the service began with a smaller snack before the stop in Moscow. Here, all passengers had to get off the airplane, even if you continued to Singapore. Moscow was an annoying but thankfully short stop. Be prepared to show your passport/bording pass 4-5 times though, as there were several controls, and one proper security checkpoint. Nothing insufferable, but annoying nonetheless. After taking off again from Moscow, the rest of the trip was a breeze. The service from the crew was excellent, with food, beverages and complimentary items. It was a 10 hour flight but it went by quickly thanks to the wonderful seat back entertainment system. There were more movies than you could ever hope to watch during a flight, as well as games, tv-series, books and music, all of it free! The only thing you had to pay for was the wifi. As such, I didn't check the cost, since I had enough free entertainment. As we began our descent the crew cleaned up nicely, and handed out the necessary immigration forms, if needed. The plane itself was only a few months old at the time and felt very modern. Everything looked stylish and clean. All in all, I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines economy class on this flight. I have flown business class once before, and this was honestly not that far removed from that service, excluding the seat of course. I'd happily fly with them again!",1
"  Birmingham to Dubai. We were supposed to fly on the 17th May. Unfortunately the flight was delayed by 5 hours, we arrived at the airport in plenty of time but upon arrival we were told that we couldn’t fly as security had gone home. We eventually flew 24 hours later, at check in we were given a form advising we could claim 600 euros per passenger for the delay. When we arrived back I have raised a complaint with Emirates who won’t pay the 600 euros. I spoke to a flight claims company who advised we should be paid this money and are willing to take on the claim for half of the compensation. Emirates customer care doesn’t reply to emails and you can’t speak to any on the phone.",0
  Their check in staff kept us waiting for over an hour while we waited for their confirmation to let us through. In turn we lost our flight and they took our bags. They refused to compensate us for the missing bags (which were returned by another airline) and the stress and expenses we had from not having our bags and missing our flight.,0
" Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.",1
"  Lahore to Frankfurt via Istanbul in business class. Extremely disappointed with this pathetic airline.  Lahore to Istanbul the aircraft was A330-300. And everything about the flight was sub standard. The seat layout was at least 20 years old, when business class seats hardly just reclined. No storage space. The kit they provided had nothing in it. Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect. They provided a menu card, the seats layout was modern. Like proper fully reclining seats. I feel awful the way they discriminate with flights from Pakistan.",0
" Worst business class experience I have ever had, and they blame it all on Covid. The only positives I will say are flight attendants and mostly on time experience. The rest was as bad as a discount airline. I flew 6 flights, roundtrip LAX to IST, IST to ASY, ASY to ADB (via IST), ADB to IST. Turkish is supposed to have great food service. Well, a 13 hour flight and we got two boxed lunches with cafeteria quality food. Limited beverages. No snacks. That was both ways on the long-haul. Tell me how covid doesn't live on a cold box, but it would on a warm wrapped sandwich? How does it not live on a box, but apparently a bag of chips or crackers or candy? When asked you could tell the flight attendants were embarrassed. On the short flights in Turkey in Business, you got a 4 oz cup of water. Apparently Covid doesn't live on water container, but does on soda or juice? Add to this that they brag about access to business lounge. Domestic and Intl closed at IST, so they pack you into regular club. No social distancing and Domestic lounge only had prepacked rolls and a cheese sandwich. Intl had hot food, but the lines were 15 to 20 persons deep. In Izmir, no lounge due to COVID, even though other Lounges open. In Kayseri, no lounge open and you had to carry your bags from check-in to a luggage belt with no assistance. And they don't allow any carry on bigger than backpack or shopping bag, even in Business on 13 hour flight. In LAX, they didn't open check-in until 2.5 hours before departure, even though the staff said 3 hours. And they were flying 787 from LAX but switched to old 777 with 2/3/2 configuration where either you get crawled over or you crawl over someone. And the seats are designed for multi directional recline, but they don't work. Wifi wouldn't connect on laptop, iPhone or Android. 3 flight attendants tried to help, but couldn't get it to work. Turkish sent an email apologizing and offered 25% discount on next flight if booked in 30 days/travel in 60. That's really helpful to someone living in the US! To blame COVID safety precautions for what is merely an attempt to save money is shameful, especially when they cram people together at check-in and in lounges. And to advertise the lounges, meals, etc. when booking business is nothing short of criminal. I've flown a dozen airlines over the water probably 50 or 60 roundtrips, and this is by far the worst. Stay away.",0
" This is the worst airline, poor customer service. Do not waste your time and money to travel using this airline. My luggage lost in Istanbul and very hard to track this. Poor communication and do not understand simple English. ",0
"  Mexico City to Paris. Very limited leg room, the screen equipment almost falling apart, dirty toilets, terrible food and inattentive flight crew. What else can one ask when travelling on such a long flight?! Never ever again.",0
"  Copenhagen-Paris-Zurich-Paris on 17-18 Sep 23 on A220-300 and A320 aircrafts. Had to position myself in Zurich to catch my Kenya Airways (AF-codeshare) from there to Nairobi and Jo-burg. Tricky to check-in the luggage from CPH for the entire trip but by jumping the Zurich part, the luggage could be tagged simpler and eventually made it the whole way (5 legs) to Jo-burg. While Zurich became just a turnaround point with the same aircraft the return leg, however, was in business class: a clear step beyond economy, though identical, modest seats. The check-in in CPH went well but the handling agent refused to transfer my luggage beyond the first 2 legs which caused me immense trouble and rebooking in ZRH as I could not catch my onward flight. The time slot became too narrow to retrieve and recheck in luggage which I already informed of in CPH, but in vain: “we don’t do transfer on different tickets” despite being the same airline and even on the same (returning) aircraft. Lounges provided as elite traveller were fine in all three airports. Onboard, crew were courteous and effective. The A220 is a blessing, likely the best narrowbody aircraft I have flown. All flights were clean, punctual or early. Service on board very modest, but a few drinks, hot drinks, and snack provided. Huge advantage being elite FFP-traveller these days accessing their newer lounges and getting other perks.",1
"  My partner and I requested wheelchair and assistance. He has his own electric wheelchair. I have been in front of the business class counter where we asked if they had a priority line and solicited the wheelchair and asked where to go. We got a few contradictory answers (and many employees’ nasty looks) and, after sitting on the luggage and floor por 40 minutes, because the request of a young couple that felt bad about my situation, the left a wheelchair at my side and no assistance. I am afraid of losing the flight and am still being ignored after about an hour and 15 min.  This company doesn’t have the most basic respect for the passengers! Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They don’t even pretend to care! I don’t know if I am going to a developed country anymore. The introduction is not good. When I finally got assistance, the lady helping me was extremely nice (Mariluz). Value for money - a waste of money Ground service below horrifying.",0
"  Los Angeles to Incheon. The booking, check in and website infrastructure/system are very frustrating and error prone. I have been on multiple flights with them and almost missed a flight because my boarding pass would not scan at the gate. Recently my flight was delayed because people had trouble boarding at the gate as well. Checking in on their website has been an issue because the information requested had no entry field. Checking in at the kiosk at the airport printed all of my fellow travelers boarding passes but only 1 of mine. When I tried to check in to print the rest of mine it errored out and I had to wait for the check in time for my flight at the korean air counter so a person could fix it. A lot of small annoyances add up to make this airline an unpleasant one to travel with. Also the seats on their smaller planes are concave and incredibly uncomfortable. The bigger planes are better.",0
"  Frankfurt to Doha provided a comfortable and service oriented flight. The only downsize was the poor quality of food in Economy. Transfer in Doha was easy, due to the Al Maha transfer service an lounge access due to my Platinum status with Qatar. There was a pleasant surprise at the gate, as I got an upgrade due to an overbooked flight. I love the herringbone configuration and the bar on the A380. service and food was impeccable on this flight. I would have given full rating, but can’t because of the  poor meal on the Frankfurt to Doha sector.",1
" Perth to Singapore. It has been a long time since I last flew SQ, I am pleased to say nothing has changed they are still the same high standard they were. Check in at Perth was fast. Boarding was by zones and very orderly and efficient, lots of happy smiles and “welcome aboard” from the cabin crew stationed throughout the aircraft. The aircraft was showing its age but was very clean and the seats were very comfortable, ample leg room (I am 6ft) and good recline. Seats were already prepared with blankets, pillows and headphones. Safety checks carried out a number of times prior to and during taxi. Shortly after take-off service commenced with hot towels followed by a very good breakfast. During this 5 hour flight the crew passed through the cabin at least 4 times with trays of water and juice. Inflight entertainment was excellent with plenty to watch and listen to.The only criticism of this flight was the cabin temperature, freezing, the blanket proved essential. That said all in all a very comfortable flight with great service.",1
"  Well coordinated airbridge (a rarity at Doha airport nowadays) boarding. Newish B789 with comfortable seats, large and responsive IFE screens and decent food. Cabin crew was enthusiastic and helpful. Flight arrived ahead of time.",1
"  Doha to Perth. After just arriving from London, the plane was late which meant a very quick turnover for the start of what I thought would be a gruelling 11hr flight to Perth only to be made more so pleasant by the kindness and professional services of a cabin staff. The plane was full and people were understandably restless, including myself. Staff remained calm, professional and helpful throughout the long duration of the flight which put my mind at ease knowing i was in good hands.",1
"  Singapore to Hong Kong. The cabin crew in general was warm, and tended to our needs promptly throughout the flight. However the Boeing 777-200ER, is one of the more antiquated aircraft in SQ's fleet and it is in desperate need of a makeover - for one, the IFE looked like something that came from the 1990s or the early 2000s, and the IFE was not very responsive, and ended up jamming up 1hr before landing in Hong Kong. If that was not bad enough, my friend who was seated next to me(seat 45B) suffered from less legroom than other economy class passengers due to the IFE box that was under the seat in front of his. However, the service from the flight attendants was outstanding-no surprises as to why SQ can consistently rank as one of the top airlines. On the return flight, the equipment was the same; however, the aircraft came in late, and departure was delayed by 15 minutes! On top of that, after boarding we could not push back due to ""traffic congestion"" and ended up taking off 1 hour behind schedule! Hardware wise, still the same experience as the outbound flight; however, the cabin crew was just as warm, polite and made us feel welcomed on board and attended to our every need promptly-again, top marks for that. All in all, a pleasant flight experience with Singapore Airlines and given the price, would definitely choose them again",1
  Customer service is rude. Food was rotten. Had a great connection flight but a few days before flight received an Email informing me that that my connection flight would be delayed 15 hours due to operational needs. Flying with 2 young boys a 2 and a 4 year old is a nightmare when you have to spend 15 hours for a connection flight. Also upon requesting a hotel room for the wait emirates refused. I'll never fly Emirates again.,0
"  AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away. They could have easily checked me into the next flight if they were only willing to be a little helpful.",0
"  Seoul to Madrid. The flight crew provided professional and courteous service. I like flying on the Boeing 787 and it did not disappoint. The  economy food is never a great quality for any airline, but it was adequate. One thing I like with Korean Air is that flight attendants always try to meet your request and on this flight was no exception. The new economy seats and IFE screens were good. IFE movie and TV show selection could be more extensive. As majority of Koreans fly on Korean Air if they had more Korean movies and TV shows, Korean passengers would appreciate that.",1
"  Having previously flown this route on PIA, I was eager to try absolutely any other airline. Having said that, Qatar with its brilliant reputation and reasonable fares made the obvious choice this time around. They didn't disappoint. We flew out on the 777-300ER (when we booked it was supposed to be the 787 but was later changed to this), where the seats were comfortable (reasonable leg room for Economy class), food was to a high standard and the IFE had a huge selection of movies/TV shows to select from. The staff were courteous at all times as well. From Doha to Islamabad it was the A320 which despite being a smaller aircraft had the similar feel to the 777. The IFE was of the same quality, food (although only served once) too was of the similar high standard. All in all, a fantastic experience and more than likely to fly with them again.

 Hong Kong to Manila. I was quite elated that my husband purchased tickets from this airline since it was a reputable carrier known to me whenever I travelled during my early teens. I ended up disappointed. They only open air con when the plane flies. The engine was noisy. They only served a sandwich wrap for food. Juices will only be served if you ask. They don't offer condiments. I will give it a 3.5 star since we got the flight on sale and we arrived safely,0
"  Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport.  On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.",1
  I flew Economy from Singapore to Dubai via Doha on Qatar Airways and I was absolutely impressed. Service is top level that it beats SQ service - something which is very hard. Legroom space and seat pitch is amazing in Economy and the F&B are better than SQ. ,1
" One way flight from Paris CDG to Berlin BER in April. A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe.",1
" Flew Air France from Orly to Toulon. It's snowing today. Just a little, nothing like a tempest. Temperature is terrible : -1C. AF 7508 was supposed to board at 1730. Boarding started at 1750 and finished at 1817. In addition, the pilot informs us : - 1 hr delay for De-icing! No electricity in a while due to the ground generator breaking. Flight duration: 1 hr 15. No water, nothing proposed by the crew. Very nice airline when customer is treated like a cow. It's a pity there is no competition on this route.",0
"  My husband, grandson and myself recently flew Auckland to London return via Seoul. We had made this trip on Korean Air on two previous occasions, and once again enjoyed the complimentary night's accomodation at the 5 star Grand Hyatt at Incheon, which also included a delicious dinner and breakfast. Korean Air is a most generous airline, in terms of legroom in their economy class and the overnight stopover they provide on the Auckland to London flight. What particularly impressed us this trip was the trouble the ground staff went to locate and then hand deliver the wallet my grandson left onboard the aircraft when we landed in Seoul on the homeward leg. It was only when we checked in for the last leg of the flight to Auckland, after a three day stopover in Seoul that he mentioned the wallet was missing. The young lady at check in made a series of phone calls, located the wallet and arranged for it to be delivered to the departure lounge. Korean Air certainly understand the meaning of customer service.",1
"  I bought Two tickets for same route Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore and return Sydney to Colombo. At the purchased time System shows that I can earn about 43000 Tier and 48000 miles for each ticket. The first ticket I bought to travel in November and second for travel on February 2018. After I used first trip Colombo to Melbourne, before return from Sydney to Colombo I saw on Emirates Apps that the my Tier and miles cutting to half. After I make contact with Emirates, Asking I send any screenshot from miles was offered to me. I think no any one people think any airline want to cut or cheat to take any screenshot from miles. Just I keep my ticket and no miles shows in tickets. After I come back from first trip, I requested Emirates to see computers logs and later Emirates just said sorry was miles calculated in error. I asking supervisor to take look in my case and miles credited to my account for fist ticket. I requested to do same for second ticket. But until now I didn't find that emirates do for it. Many peoples compare routes and flights that can make more tier and miles for more benefits. So this is important for me to recover my Miles. I suggest to all taking full screenshots from any ticket and other documents may can show later to not cut or cheat anything by airlines.",1
 I had read many negative reviews about this airline so was a little apprehensive. I’m very happy to report that our experience couldn’t have been better. From checking in to boarding it was all seamless. The cabin crew were absolutely lovely and so attentive to everyone. The seat was very comfortable and food was generally ok. We would’ve preferred a sweet option for breakfast but apart from that everything was perfect. Will definitely fly Qatar again!,1
"  Night flight Amsterdam - Dubai followed by a short hop to Muscat. Slept very well on the A380, good connection in DXB and then a 46 min flight to Oman. I like Emirates' consistent level of service. Their pricing remains sharp, they really connect the world. Not to forget their excellebt webiste: so easy to manage one's booking, reserve seats, upgrade using miles. Food the only item to improve.",1
  Incheon to Johannesburg via Doha. The service is exceptional! Cabin crew are really friendly and helpful. The meals are delicious and toiletry bags are provided so you have everything you could need during the flight. My favorite airline by far.,1
"  My issue with Air France is that I bought a No fee change ticket and since trying to change my return ticket which is on the 8th May 2022 I have got nothing but the run around. As for a customer service it is non existent. I am in Peru and cannot get my flight from Costa Rica on that date and I did manage to chat with some form of humanoid/robot on their chat line via facebook, for 6 days messaging back and forth with no actual assistance whatsoever. Every time I suggested a flight or date I could exchange my ticket for they told me I could not do it. There is no customer service, no one to speak to or even email, and once they have your money you are hung out to dry. Hence they have taken £612 for a flight that is worth £300 due to the fact that they will not not honour their no fee change policy. I am not asking for a refund but to exchange my ticket for another flight. I have already stated that I am prepared to pay extra if it is a flight that is more expensive. ",0
"  Amsterdam to Singapore. Great food. Entertainment is ok. They have many Hollywood movies. Service is the best. Because I didn’t eat much, the stewardess asked if they could give me something else. Will definitely fly again.",1
"  Phnom Penh to Manchester via Doha. Have flown Qatar Airways several times over the last few years and it has been generally good, with friendly, helpful staff. But I have had problems with the in-flight entertainment system, which is difficult to operate and often has faults though not broken. The food is average at best. Meals are very small and the light meal / snack is always the same: a hot baked thing (sweet or savoury option) which they call a sandwich but is something different, with a small, poor cake. The chicken sandwiches are quite unpleasant and difficult to eat, but when you're hungry and there is no alternative offered, what can you do?",1
"  3 years has changed the ethos of the Cathay. I checked in from Bangkok at 4.30pm on 1/4/23 to catch a connecting flight to Narita via Hong Kong. In Bangkok I requested to be seated with my wife. The staff said that the Hong Kong Narita seating can only be changed in Hong Kong. When we reached Hong Kong we waited 30 min to be attended to and was informed that the seating could only be changed at the boarding gate. The staff were only present at 12.15am for a 1.20am flight. When they arrived, I asked about the seat change and I was just answered seat remains the same. Cannot change - that was the staff’s exact words. I just walked away and swore never to fly Cathay again. Cathay has deteriorated in quality so rapidly.",0
"  Not recommended if you have food restriction. I requested many days via App and call before my flight SIN to LHR for gluten free and non-beef mean. However my requests were pending for both flights. The crew offered to serve me “Pasta with bread’ instead of gluten free meal. After feeding back to the airlines, there’s no response from them.",0
"  Dublin to Tel Aviv via İstanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but that’s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in İstanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from İstanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days.  I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see what’s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think it’s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there’s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn’t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it’s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can’t get it. And she said you know it’s your fault that it went to Eilat. When I asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me.",0
" New York to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. I have so many bad words in my mind about this airline. It was the first and the last time I chose it. My return trip was yesterday, JFK to Ataturk, due to a 2.5 hours delay I lost my connection flight to Thessaloniki. When I came out of the plane there is no one to help me out with my flight, I was asking the ground staff and they talk to me in a rude and sarcastic manner because I dont speak Turkish. I was waiting in a very long line (100 people or more, all of them lost their connection flights) to change my ticket. My new ticket was at 20:15 evening and I had arrived at 9 am. I was waiting for 11 hours to go home! They take as at a hotel for almost 4 hours, the hotel and the ground staff had the worst attitude I have ever seen! They didn't show us any respect, long lines, no directions, no answers, no English, nothing except of rudeness. Now I'm home after 26 hours, instead of 14. For me Turkish is really the worst airline and has the worst ground stuff. Waste of money and time!",0
"  I have flown with Turkish Airlines over a 100 times in business and in economy and they have never disappointed me. Always great staff, great food, good inflight entertainment, free headphones and blankets, new planes except TK35. I highly recommend this airline.",1
"  Singapore to Jakarta on an A350-900 (9V-SMD). Flight left behind schedule. We waited for like 30+ minutes after scheduled departure time on ground in Singapore before push back to avoid getting trapped in air traffic congestion in Jakarta. Excellent communication from Flight Deck. Flight Attendants on this flight worked hard, providing lunch service with two drink runs on a full flight for such a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). FAs were very cheerful and polite. I pre-ordered in-flight merchandise (aircraft models) and they brought it to me before the flight lands. Aircraft was a new A350, the cabin was bright and airy. and large windows adding to a sense of space. Entertainment using the latest touchscreen which is very easy and fun to use.  Only gripe I had was one piece of our luggage was stranded in Singapore and didn't make it on our flight, but after checking with SQ baggage service person in Jakarta we were told that it will arrive on the next flight from Singapore 2.5 hours later. The issue with the delayed/misplaced bag happened most likely because we were connecting in Singapore an hour before this flight from our previous flight from Houston.",1
"  Tel Aviv to Seoul. Have flown this year with KE 3 times now. Our last flight with KE in August was the best. We are a family of 3 (baby 1 year old). Cabin crew was so nice and cared for us throughout the flight. We sat in the 2nd row of economy on one flight. I asked for cabin crew for something to drink which they said they have back in the galley (i told never mind and asked for something else). After finishing providing meals for others the staff came back especially with my drink. Check in was super fast on all flight, boarding on time, seats comfortable (I am a big guy) food was ok, movie selection changed on the 2 flights (so i had full new options to watch on both ways), flights on time.",1
  Paris to Atlanta. Very hard seat. The food was without taste. Wine great. Service during the flight almost non-existent. Near the end we did see 3 offering of water. The breakfast was a “pizza hot pocket” warm yogurt and bad juice. Great coffee but not enough. I did not eat my “breakfast.” Their motto French in the air. It is not! What a great country with excellent food choices and comfort.,0
" Turkish Airlines denied boarding for some apparent miscommunication between Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Government, according to the last communication from Turkish the government put out on December 30, 2020 effective immediately a requirement for COVID 19 test for transit passengers. According to Turkish this requirement was voided on same day 12/30/2020, however Turkish failed to communicate to the passengers the new requirement. I had called on 12/29/2020 to verify if we needed a test and Turkish Call Center indicated no test was required. However, I did get an email from Turkish on 12/30/2020 at 7pm, when we landed in Houston (on another airline at our own expense) that passengers in transit in Istanbul did not need a COVID-19 test. Turkish Airlines has not assumed the responsibility to communicate the changes or to repair the loses they caused us.",0
"  Malé to Dubai. Another very unpleasant flight on Emirates Boeing 777. The seat pitch and width is ridiculous - legroom is limited even for for petite body type ladies. Space under the front seat is reduced even more by a box of equipment. IFE is classic 777 with lots of movies and options, but on a very small and badly lit screen. Wifi was not working, even though not over countries that prohibit it. On the positive side, food was good and flight departed and arrived on time.",0
"  It appears that Singapore Airlines slogan ""Placing you at the heart of everything we do"", only applies when you are actually travelling, any customer service does not extend to dealing with complaints about delays quickly and efficiently. We were delayed 24 hours in September 2023, and are still waiting for the airline to comply with UK civil aviation authority compensation rules.",0
" Istanbul to Budapest via Dublin with Turkish Airlines. Delays on each flight for both legs of the journey - stuck in Istanbul for almost 20 hours with ground staff who  were rude, slow or unhelpful and took an hour to get our bags. The only only thing positive I can say is that the food on the plane is good, everything else was disastrous.",0
"  I took flight QR719 Doha to Seattle on 20th Oct. Neha the cabin crew was super nice during the whole journey. She was so friendly and warm and thoughtful, she made this long flight so much enjoyable, she was so attentive and always provided assistance.  She's really great, and I think it's really lucky for Qatar Airways to have her.",1
"  Toronto to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey. It was a pleasant experience on the balance and the cabin chief deserved special mention given how he handled my request to be moved to another seat.",1
"  I travel a lot and I never thought Qatar Airways would be my best options for travelling to USA . The crew were lovely and so helpful on ground and in the plane, they were so friendly and professional, and they treat all passengers nicely. Doha Airport were amazing and the duty free has a lot of options. The most important that they were on time. The food were so nice and they will never let you miss a meal even if you sleep, the crew wake you up to ask you for food and bring it ASAP .",1
"  London to Doha. I decided to fly Qatar business class to  experience the Q-suite. I found out after I boarded that the aircraft was changed. It was a dated plane, seating was 2-2-2 and there was no privacy. Movies titles were limited, the charging port doesn't work and seat was uncomfortable. I wrote to Qatar but the response quoted  the conditions of carriage that the flight is subject to change without notice. I would have expected a more positive response and it was a huge disappointment that Qatar failed to deliver and resolve my expectations of deciding to travel with the airline solely for the Q-suite experience. ",1
"  Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada.  It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: “Reissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn’t see was the fine print at the bottom: “Turkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.”. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn’t. I don’t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered “I can’t accept this”. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day. Turkish Airlines is different. This is truly a horrible company with mean spirited employees.",0
"  Paris to Madrid. The product does not correspond to business class. The seats are the same as in the economy, the distance for the legs is not increased, the middle chair does not even transform into a table. The food is scarce and tasteless - two cold starters, a slice of cheese and a little chocolate bar. The staff responds to requests, but they are not particularly willing to do so. Wines in small bottles on a screw cap; champagne is not bad. This class of seating should at best be called premium-economy, if not Economy at all with slightly improved nutrition, but not business at all. Продукт совершенно не соответсвует бизнес-классу. Сидения такие же как в экономе, расстояния для ног не увеличены, среднее кресло даже не трансформируется в столик. Еды мало и невкусная - две холодные закуски, кусочек сыра и маленькая шоколадка. Персонал отзывается на просьбы, но делают это не особо охотно. Вина в маленьких бутылочках на винтовой крышке , шампанское неплохое. Этот класс обслаживания в лучшем случае должен называться premium-economy, если вообще не Economy с чуть улучшенным питанием, но никак не бизнес",0
"  I was extremely disappointed how it handled things around the Corona virus: Had no checks carried out either at the airports on before the flight, not even a temperature check. On the airport and on the flight as well I've seen sick people, people who were coughing.  When I was flying out to Australia countries have started to introduced lockdown measures so I have decided to move my return flight forward (to make sure I don't stuck on the other side of the world). Whilst Emirates guaranteed ticket flexibility to people who were travelling during this period (they let you change the travel time) I was disgusted by the fact that if you change your return flight Emirates will charge you for a one way ticket which is double the price of a return ticket. So instead of you only paying for the difference between your new ticket and the old ticket you also have to pay for the difference between a single trip and round trip which is absolutely ridiculous and I don't think it's at all acceptable. The Emirates website was saying that all tickets are sold out for they flight I've chosen and on other flight I would have had to pay even more so I bought a ticket from Qantas (which turned out to be on an Emirates flight) I've submitted a cancellation request on my original Emirates flight on 20th March and still hasn't received any response. I could't be more disappointed with Emirates, especially that I never got my unused ticket refunded. Due to this bad experience I wouldn't use Emirates again and would talk anyone out of using them.",0
"  The large upstairs business class on the A380 is often relatively empty on the Bangkok to Hong Kong route route but on this short 2-day round trip both sectors were virtually full. Only the excellent bar at the back seemed to attract just a few passengers. The privacy in the window seats is superb, the large IFE screens make those of some airlines seem small in comparison, and a very extensive IFE programming. FAs go about their business calmly and flat bed seats are popular with some passengers who prefer to nap than partake of the meal service. With Emirates ticket prices for business class vastly cheaper than any other airline, this flight is quite literally a steal!",1
"  Milan to Male via Doha in February 2020. Qatar Airways is the most beautiful airways in the world. Airbus A350 is a great aircraft, so silent and comfortable. Cabin staff are very gentle, food is top quality. Thank you Qatar Airways for making our trip so good.",1
  Sydney to Nairobi via Dubai. My seat did not recline. No help from staff. My 3rd flight with Emirates in a row where there has been a problem. Standards have fallen below requirement. And good luck getting a response from their team afterwards. ,0
" Copenhagen to Doha in Business Class on a Boeing 787-9. Qatar Airways lived up to its reputation as the finest Business Class product. On this 787-9, the seats were the older type (not the Qsuite) but very comfortable nevertheless. Onboard service was flawless. Qatar serves meals on demand in Business Class. If there is one point of criticism it is that the food served could do with more attention to both the quality and care in preparation. WiFi worked very well throughout the flight. All in all, a relaxing, comfortable flight.",1
"  At Melbourne airport the check-in was very quick and friendly, and the lounge was pleasant and had a good selection of food and drink. Onboard the cabin crew was welcoming, and the seat on the B777 was very comfortable with adequate storage though the diagonal arrangement for lying flat was awkward. No amenities kit was provided. The quality of the vegetarian meals was way above that of other airlines. The flight arrived in Singapore a little early and transfer to a nearby gate for the second leg to Japan leaving in 70 minutes was easy. The boarding process was efficient, and the crew on the B787 were also welcoming and the seat was comfortable (not diagonal for sleeping), though storage space was more limited. The flight arrived on time and luggage was available quickly. All in all a very pleasant journey.",1
" Flew Emirates from New York JFK to Milan. The flight itself was good, but! This is a big but! They do not call groups, they form lines like cattle and make you wait! In my case 40 minutes standing in very warm conditions, 10 minutes late. I am extremely unhappy with their boarding process, horrible.",0
"  New York to Chennai via Dubai. Went in with great expectations, but it was an average experience. Flight from JFK to Dubai was okay but the flight from Dubai to Chennai was worse. IFE was not so responsive and did not have extensive collection. Food was just okay (opted for asian vegetarian). I am a pure vegetarian and I pre ordered it while booking tickets. But crew told vegetarian meal was not available when coming to me and then I have to argue with them to get my vegetarian meal. Overall average experience for a world class airline - I had been in Qatar Airways before and it was way better.",0
"  Cabin crew were amazing. In-flight service is the best I've had so far. Food was good and cutleries clean and neatly wrapped. Aircraft looked really new and clean. Seating was quite comfortable. Overall, I had a pleasant experience flying Qatar airways and would gladly choose to fly them again",1
"  San Francisco to Bangkok via Tokyo. The inflight entertainment wasn't the best for the SFO to NRT hour flight, and of course was the same from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok flight.  The vegetarian (lacto ovo) meal was awful. However, the service from the staff was outstanding. The price was great (booked via united airlines), but would hesitate to fly this airline again. Seats were of average comfort, and seat pitch was great on the Boeing 777-300, not so much on the Boeing 777-200.",0
" What an exceptional First Class Journey from stepping onboard to leaving the door. I was greeted at the door of the aircraft and ushered left to seat 1A. I was instantly served Salon 2006 Champagne and shortly afterwards offered leisure clothing of my size, and offered that opportunity to change into it before departure. The bathroom had a padded drop-down floor and seat so that you didn’t have to stand on the floor or toilet to change! Then all five staff working in First Class bowed and introduced themselves, and the Japanese 9-cousre menu started shortly after take-off. Many fine champagnes and sakis were offered and enjoyed, as well as the offer of the entire Japanese menu after mentioning that I had not tried many Japanese cuisines. As there were only two people occupying the 8-seat First Class cabin, the crew made up the suite opposite into a bed for me so I could sleep when it suited me. After about 3 hours of sleep they asked me if I wanted more food and drink. Nearing arrival, I was presented with a bag containing a Business Class amenity kit (having complimented them on the First Class Porsche Design kit, and they wanted me to have a Zero Halliburton one), some Japanese photos and two bottles of water for my onward journey. If only BA could provide anything near such perfection. JAL is wonderful and their premium product is perfection!!",1
  Perth to Hanoi via Singapore. The crew were very friendly and accommodating. The food was tasty and well presented. Cannot fault the airline. Singapore Airlines is one of the best I have travelled on in a long time,1
" I checked in online and arrived at the Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport 45 minutes early to upgrade to business /or/ first class depending on availability. I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in ""Priority check in"" free. No customers to serve. I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her. I told her I want to upgrade. She replied, with a stern look, and said ""come back at 7"". The time was 6.15 pm. She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist. Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter. I went back, again all 3 agents were free. They said they cannot help. I became angry. Another client came with the same situation. Yet that client had already her business class tickets. She was treated the same way. She said she had “never” seen such service. Ok now its 7pm. I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients! The economy class is whizzing by, the ones in “Priority are waiting to be served. I approach the second agent I see walking by to ask her what is going on? Clearly, I was very upset. Rather than answer me she threatens to call security! Are you for real? She claims not to like my “tone”! Question: Air France: Why are you putting agents such as these in “Priority” check in? Please I need to understand! I am on a seven-week European vacation with my husband. I was so happy and then this? Do your clients happiness matter to you? Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people. Clearly they are unhappy people who should not be greeting happy travellers. I am so disappointed with the service at the check in counter at YUL airport! The rest of our trip was excellent!",0
"  Dubai to Kuwait in economy class. At the check-in counter, we asked the lady if she could put a priority bag on our luggage which she did. However, when I reached Kuwait, my luggage came much later than it should have. I did not expect Emirates airlines to have such a bad service",0
"  This was the return leg of BA reward flight to Kuala Lumpur. As is possible BA route you on difficult legs from time to time and so I accepted the KUL-HKG-LHR routing very reluctantly. I am reviewing Hong Kong to London here. The plane took off 15 minutes late from HKG with a further 30 minutes on the apron for some reason. Cabin crew asked what we wanted for dinner and I made a choice and also made a request for a cocktail and although they had the ingredients for Negroni the attendant said she couldn't make one. I said I'd make it but she also told me they do not offer drinks in miniature bottles. I changed the order to a large Bloody Mary. In very short order they started laying the dinner table and I reminded her that I wanted a drink. This took some 25 minutes to arrive with 4 cabin crew talking in a group (perhaps working out how to make it). It was clear that I was not getting a second. No nuts were offered although my partner opposite was given some. My meal arrived - some very nice stir fried fish. There was no starter no salt or pepper. I was told starters were optional and I should have asked for one. This was the salad I didn't get. I asked for a glass of wine. The male attendant said he would get the wine list. I mean they only offer 4. I said the first bottle you come to. I got a glass of white. He said it's sauvignon blanc by the way. I didn't hear him and asked him what he had said (I'm 75 - I'm a little deaf - it happens). He told me how sorry he was that his accent was difficult to understand.  Odd comment. No pudding was offered but I asked for one and got an ice cream. The staff was borderline polite but everyone was going to sleep and quickly. I got up for a lavatory break. They were in use. ""The clue, said one of the young ladies ,is that if the sign says they're in use, they are"". The point of the detail is to illustrate that they didn't care. I will not use them again. 2 stars and reflects the thousands of GBP I had to spend to obtain the necessary avios to purchase this flight.",0
"  Coming from Orlando on a very long flight, the plan departed 2h late and landed late, which caused missing our connection. I have travelled with 2 kids so coming from a 12h long flight and being greeted with a voucher for few meals preselected by airlines (like an apple and tomato sandwich, banana and noodle soup…things that are super unpleasant for kids to start with) super cheap offering and I have to get stuck for almost 5h on the airport with two extremely tired kids with no comfort and proper food due to airline mistake. When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is “the best” he will offer and turned his back. So I was extremely disappointed to experience such a treatment from such an airline, they don’t take responsibility to what is their mistake and my feedback is not bothering them at all. The real Emirates service is not the one they advertise to hook you up!",0
" I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew. It was more of a great experience rather than a journey. Right from the entrance to the aircraft I was treated like a beloved family member who came to see the family after years by every staff member. Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can. I am a frequent flyer of Emirates, though the maintenance inside aircraft has compromised that fresh and modern look but their crew members compensated that by miles. My special thanks and 7 star to every single staff member in the busines class cabin.",1
"  Fly with Turkish Airlines at your own risk. If there are problems that arise at any point during your experience with Turkish Airlines, please note that their level of customer service is amongst the worst in the world. Why? Issues are dealt with very slowly, any refunds can take more than four weeks to arrive, telephone representatives do not take responsibility for cases and will misinform and misadvise (possibly through a lack of training), there is nowhere to complain to a human being, all issues must be raised using a feedback form on the Turkish Airlines website which puts the ball in their court and leaves the customer with zero control of a situation, if Turkish Airlines see a case as closed then they will email you to inform you and then request you to raise a new feedback form in order to respond, and I could go on. Quite simply, shambolic customer service, however it is possible that you won't require any, so roll the dice if you so wish.",0
"  Taipei to Hong Kong, they only provide one cake and one juice for this flight which left me  disappointed. I will choose other airlines to Hong Kong or Macau for my flight.",0
  Onboard everything is great with Qatar Airways. Fabulous service and offerings. Thoughtful and lovely crew. The issue was partly not the blame of Qatar. Checking in at Barajas I had all the correct paperwork including the PCR test done the day before. They decided they didn’t like the document and that I had to have a last minute pcr at the airport. Luckily all ok but the result wasn’t enough and had to email it and it had to be read on a computer before I could board. All papers checked again at Doha resulting in flight being 2 hours delayed. I think it’s the Hong Kong arrivals that pushed It. On the flight extremely impressed. They switch aircraft type a lot which worked on my favour. I like the backward facing seat actually.,1
"  July 15th, 2016 I flew from Oslo to Manila via Istanbul. We landed normally on time, July 15th, 11pm in Istanbul for a short transfer for the next flight - but that was not to be. Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos. I ended up having to go online and buy a new one-way ticket out of Istanbul. Travel Tip: Find another airline. ",0
"  Round trip for a weekend getaway flying from Seoul to Tokyo. As always an extremely efficient boarding of 100% full plane in just 20 minutes at both Gimpo and Haneda airports. Cabin spotless and excellent condition. Crew professional and polite as always. I normally enjoy the food on ANA except for HND-GMP steamed seafood dish. I appreciate the effort of multiple seafood types on an airplane, but literally zero taste on this one. At HND, I didn't check my bag with duty free alcohol and was sent to check it in with just 25 minutes before take off. The staff politely hurried me back to the counter and again through security and the bag still made it. Impressive!",1
"  Seoul to Kathmandu. First was told 3 hour delay due to technical difficulties then further 2 hr delay due to same reason. When asked, no proper reasoning was provided. All was said was sorry. I find sorry as a very inadequate answer to such a huge problem. Lack of proper answer and reasoning to delay from airlines authority was more than aggravating. No compensation whatsoever and shady reasoning gives me enough reason to avoid this airlines in my future travel. And would strongly recommend others to avoid this airline.",0
"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona.",0
"  It was a very pleasant experience, starting from the Check in right up to the baggage collection. There was an issue with my boarding pass, which also was handled in the best possible and pleasant manner.",1
" Flight from Tel Aviv to Miami with layover in Istanbul. September 28. 10pm flight from Tel Aviv got canceled after we already boarded plane and by the time we left to get hotel it was 5.30am (about 11 hours spent at Tel Aviv airport). They gave us a new flight for next day September 29, 10pm. This flight made it to Istanbul but with very little time to make the connection to Miami. Multiple Turkish Airlines employees on airplane and in Istanbul airport told us “it’s ok, they’ll wait for you” but with very little time, we ran across airport to make the connection. As we arrived at the gate, it had been closed for five minutes. From the moment we landed in Istanbul it was absolute mayhem. They gave us another new flight for September 30th at 2pm causing us to spend 11 hours at Istanbul airport. They told us it’s not their fault nor their problem and some laugh in our face at our disappointment. From my experience, all the staff are rude, unprofessional, and dismissive. Be careful when flying with Turkish Airlines. Your travel time may go from 17 hours to 75 hours to get to your final destination (this was my case with no exaggeration). I now need a vacation from my vacation.",0
"  Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasn’t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where they’re going and no one told us. ",0
"  Istanbul to Munich. My flight had 3 hr and 45 min delay because of aircraft mechanical issue. So, I missed my connection flight with Air Canada. There is no one from Turkish Airlines in Munich airport right now. The counter is closed. I had to sleep on the airport. Turkish Airlines should have given me a hotel and send me with next flight.  This is the worst experience I could have. I spoke for 4 hours on the phone with international Turkish airline agent and after waiting for 4 hours on the phone they told me they cannot do anything and need to wait for their airport counter to open. This is ridiculous.",0
"  BNE-DXB-MAN on 4th & 5th Oct (EK435/EK017) and MAN-DXB-BNE on 19th & 20th Oct (EK020/EK434). All 4 flights in A380s, 3 in seating zone F and 1 in zone B. Seats relatively comfortable and cabin service OK but struggled to find something interesting to watch on IFE on all 4 sectors - that's why I always travel with a book - although watching Newcastle Utd hammer PSG at St James' Park live was a bonus on BNE-DXB sector. Unfortunately there was no wifi or ""live"" TV coverage on DXB-BNE return sector for which the crew apologised before departing DXB. Relatively uneventful flights that arrived & departed pretty much on time other than a 1hr delay on take off from DXB on final leg - pushed back from gate on time but held on ground for an hour due to ATC ""traffic"". Emirates actually provide a good ""one stop"" service from the east coast of Australia to Europe but the 14hr legs to & from DXB can be a struggle. Overall 7/10 and I would use again.",1
"  Very rude customer service for Turkish Airlines at Boston Logan. I was told initially without any explanation your flight after Istanbul is cancelled, so we won't let you on the plane to even get to the connecting flight. They told us we would be rebooked but they didn't even pretend to care. I was told go to JetBlue for your answer. When I asked if he could write some type of note for me to take to JetBlue he said no. He wouldn't even call because “he doesn't have the number” Additionally, first come first serve was thrown out the window when one of the representatives helped someone in the back of the line while ignoring people that got there hours before the person. Also, it's near impossible to adjust trips because nobody comes to the ticketing center until hours later. Horrendous customer support, few answers, little to no explanations. If at all possible don't fly this airline.",0
" Milan to New York JFK. We were so pleased with our Emirates experience. The lounge at Milan was clean and well appointed and staffed by super efficient and friendly people. Our flight went without a hitch. Lots of leg room, variety of entertainment, and so many food choices. We fly international about 7 times a year and have sworn off Delta. We are so grateful to have found an airline that appreciates their customers. ",1
  Taipei to Bangkok. I think onboard catering is good. I'm flying with new aircraft version so the seat will be config 3-4-3 so the seat pitch is ok (32 inch) but seat width is to small. Cabin crew is good. Inflight entertainment is okay. EVA air is one of my favourite airlines.,1
 Singapore to Edinburgh via Dubai. Was quite excited for this route but turns out to be a total nightmare and I would much rather stuck with my usual BA. The second leg of the flight from Dubai was delayed by 45 min. Plane was hot for the morning flight and cabin crew was rarely in sight for the entire 8 hours. Rarely had water or beverages offered. It felt like a budget flight. On the return flight ground staff had poor customer service. I wanted to buy an extra bag at the airport but they insisted on charging me overweight which amounted to £500 and resulting me in leaving my belongings in the UK. Inflight service was poor. Again cabin crew are rarely in sight. The second leg the snack was so dry I spat it out. Also not to mention no cabin crew was bringing out water for the flight. Overall an incredible letdown. Never flying this route again and Emirates isn’t worth the hype.,0
" SQ Silver Kris Lounge in Changi T3 was as good as normal, with excellent food choices and good seating. The flight itself was uneventful, despite a slight delay on departure. The flight was quite bumpy for sometime over Japan, which was expected and announced by the captain. Though this had nothing to do with the airline, I realized that American carriers tend to change route and altitude when encountering turbulence, while Asian carriers seem just to go through that, and I experienced that quite consistently. I ordered my meals through book-the-cook, and the Boon Tong Kee chicken rice was underwhelming, while the lobster thermidor was nice. Service was excellent as expected. Wi-fi was complementary for J passengers, and it worked quite well.",1
"  Edinburgh to Male via Doha return in Qatar Airways business class. Everything about the experience was excellent both on the ground and in the air. Great food and drink, comfortable seats, wide range of entertainment and punctual flights. The dedicated Qatar Airways arrivals lounge for premium passengers at Doha was new (to me) and worked very well.",1
"  Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization.  Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.",0
"  Singapore to Paris. My husband and I chose Singapore Airlines for the first time to visit my brother who lives in Singapore. We thought it was one of the best company. Unfortunately, it has the worst customer service we’ve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets (188 euros) to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldn’t use because of the delay were non-refundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA (because they don’t reply to emails), the company doesn’t deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets (52 euros). Not logical. Plus, they don’t want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines don’t have consideration for their customers. They don’t take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers.  We will never fly again with Singapore Airlines.",0
"  Doha to Chicago on 30th April. Evasive phone numbers, and no customer service email address? Their policy states that if a flight is set back more than 3 hours, other than weather, or an act of God,  you will be refunded. After having to offload and reboard a second plane totalling nearly 4 hours, one would think you'd be compensated. Especially after missing the next flight, and setting me back another 9 hours. After countless hours trying to get someone that will actually listen you hear the words, we are not responsible, nor refundable. The rudeness and evasive accountability is astounding. ",0
"  I really cannot praise Qatar Airways enough for this trip that started from a deserted Melbourne Airport and finished in Madrid . The boarding was done in a very quiet and systematic way and we left on time. Dinner was served with wine and was excellent and then the hostess puta soft mattress on the bed which already had a very nice soft pillow and it was happy dreams for the next 8 hours. A couple of hours before landing in Doha a nice breakfast was served and we landed on time. Better things still to come .. the transit to the flight to Madrid was achieved by simply walking to the departing gate without having to go through the hand luggage and passport checks again. The 8 hour flight to Madrid was in a A350-900 which was comfortable but the seat was less private. Everything was wonderful except the crew may have been just a tad over attentive. Still,the plane arrived on time. I paid for this flight with a voucher plus an additional 10% from a cancelled flight with Qatar. Qatar had also repaid to my credit card a fare from another cancelled flight so I must applaud their integrity . Thank you Qatar!!",1
"  Singapore to Madrid via Dubai. This is our first flying with a Emirates and I would say this is one of the worse airlines I have been. Traveling as a family of four with two you g children; we were told That we will be seated together. To our dismay our seats were separated. We were seated at the window and aisle with a stranger in between. When we raised our concerns, the staff just gave us a shrug and said that we could speak to the person and asked if they would like to change exchange their seats so at least both my kids could be seated with me. Every other airlines would be more than happy to help us in rearranging the seating arrangements and will be the ones doing the asking. However, Emirates staff were just too busy gossiping in the galley to care much about the comfort of their passengers.",0
"  Malta to Istanbul return. First time with Turkish Airlines and very impressed. The Boeing 737 to IST was new and spotless. Crew were friendly and the inflight service good. Food was impressive for a 2 hour flight and alcohol poured from a large bottle, so good measures. On the way back slightly older A319 but still spotless. Again excellent service and landed early on both flights. I will choose Turkish again.",1
  Seoul to Brisbane. I would like to comment on the high quality of service during the flight and especially mention one of the cabin crew who was most helpful (born professional) Thank you. Next trip with Korean air.,1
"  Excellent seats and service although the A380 does not have Q suite seats. I don't see how anyone surpasses Qatar's business class. The flight attendants, food, cleanliness of the aircraft were all unbeatable.",1
  The flight departed a little late. Boarding was organised. Had Aisle seat 84C which chose and paid for At booking. Gluten Free meal served early and cabin crew checked name and request for Gluten free. Best Gluten Free meals on any airline. The cabin crew on this flight worked nonstop. Water and soft drinks between meals which was good. One cabin crew stood out on this flight she was constantly attending passengers needs and had a bright energetic personality. My husband and i arrived slightly late into Brisbane but safely. First flight of 14 hours which i never felt jet lagged and flown this flight many times put it down to only drinking water with meals whole flight.,1
"  I was traveling with a baby with reduced mobility. Therefore, my husband enrolled me in a wheelchair which is clearly written in the ticket. But they declined my wheelchair at the Istanbul Airport. As a result, I was unable to take a flight from Istanbul to JFK. I did not have an international SIM and I was stranded in Istanbul. They declined my request to communicate with my husband even in this scenario. This is an extreme example of cruelty. The customer service was extremely rude and took an opportunity to get money. They were demanding $3000 for a ticket back to Dhaka each which is six times higher than my original ticket price from dhaka to Istanbul to JFK.",0
" London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door. She did not bother to smile or say goodbye to anyone.",0
  Tokyo Narita to Casablanca via Dubai. I really appreciated my flight with Emirates. The seats were really comfortable and the food was very tasty. Altough the ground service was not very good. The inflight staff was helpful and kind and it was really good.,1
"  Auckland to Cape Town via Doha. Just wanted to the ground crew at Auckland Airport for their fabulous service today, helping to get my sister-in-law checked in and upgraded with my Qmiles, she was absolutely delighted thank you. We have flown to Europe and back twice with Qatar Airways now in recent years (Business Class), and they are very much our airline of choice, and the most comfortable way to travel what is one of the longest routes in the commercial aviation world.",1
"  They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didn't offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they don't care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this.",0
"  Late night flight from Haneda to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin crew were fantastic and the cabin was clean. The seats were comfortable and amenities provided were also sufficient. However, the midnight snacks and the meals can be further improved. Also compared to other airlines, ANA inflight entertainment is very limited.",1
"  KE124, Brisbane to Incheon (A330) and KE867, Incheon to Ulaanbaatar (A330) with Korean Air. An uneventful flight which began with a quick check-in where I was recognised as an Alitalia Millemiglia Ulisse member with priority-check in and boarding. The flight itself was smooth until we were half-way into our journey from ICN to ULN when turbulent weather delayed the food service. The meals from ICN to BNE where a mixture of Asian and Western cuisine, while the food on the ICN to ULN leg were entirely Asian cuisine, comprising of chicken or beef with noodles. Overall, the food was of good quality. As for the IFE, I found the options to be reasonably plentiful to keep me occupied for the entire 15 hour trip. I would fly with Korean Air again.",1
"  The fare was through the roof but we had no choice as no other airline serves the route except Etihad and their connection times are ridiculous. The flight was on an older A350 and the age was clearly showing, the cabin staff seemed stressed and the food was limited for choice. No QSuites just the old configuration the airline is stretched because of lack of equipment. ",0
"  No staff at the transfer desk to issue boarding pass. I was told to proceed to the boarding gate for service. After one hour of waiting in a queue, several people including me were finally get their passes. While we were lining up, many travellers (probably first and business class) cut the queue to insist on going to the aircraft first.  From what I feel, they need a bigger crew to service the A380. Staff avoided eye contact with me to speed up their service. Food was not ready for the first meal. I had to wait half an hour for my main meal after finishing everything else. I was not offered a drink and when I asked, they signalled me to wait. I waited for another half an hour without any drink from the crew yet the guy two rows in front of me asked for a refill and was offered immediately. Second meal was a total disaster, it took an hour for our cabin to be served. To the point that, many people who were already served, they expected their trays to be cleared but nothing happened and many people took the matters into their own hands by bringing trays to cabin crew. Drinks were offered and served very minimally. I can confidently say it because my second flight later with an A350, it was a joy again. Everything ran on time. Polite and civilized boarding. No late service. I still can feel a drop in service as compared to pre-pandemic time.",1
"  Sydney to Singapore with the A380-800 was a pleasant experience.  Aircraft is fully equipped with the right entertainment and facilities for a long haul flight. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who did an efficient and friendly job managing the cabin. The catering however, was a major let down as there was no International option and the breakfast was merely a muffin, which is a pathetic excuse for what is marketed as a ‘continental breakfast’. Ground staff at both ends were remarkable.",1
  I give Qatar Airways the best review one can ge. Super service on the flight and in the lounge. This is the airline I will use as often as I can for the future. Thank you!,1
" Paris to Calgary. My return flight from Paris was supposed to be 5pm. However, 10:45 am someone called from Air France saying the flight was cancelled (regular business practice to save money) she only gave me an hour and half which was not enough to go through security and tax refund. So I called back and she gave me another flight one hour later but kinda threatened me that it was the last flight they offered. I thought that was rude since they are the one that cancelled the flight. Long story short I just had enough time to get on the plane. This airline charges more but offers less service which is not right",0
"  Athens to Newark. On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars. I was surprised n the difference in service between Emirates and Singapore Airlines. We encountered the same lack of service from Newark to Athens as we did on the longer return trip.",1
"  Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul. Never book Turkish airlines if you are traveling to Dublin from Mumbai. If the flight gets delay from Mumbai, they don't have any other options for you. They will straight forward ask you to stay in hotel in Istanbul. They do not care for any for your time loss. No decisions has been made from airlines crew within time. They kept me waiting for more than 3 hours.",0
" I was impressed by the airlines efficiency, starting from Houston IAH airport at check-in and further on the airport. They opened the check-in about 4 hours before the flight and in about 20 minutes since arriving at the airport I was up in the lounge, having checked in, passed immigration and security checks. The flight attendants did a very good job during the flights on both legs, it seems they take their job very seriously. Checking the passengers, baggage compartments, emergency exits was done several time by the flight attendants as a matter of safety (more times than I've seen with other airlines). During the flight they wandered around serving refreshment drinks and sandwiches and since I had trouble sleeping, I've seen them a lot. The seats were comfortable in economy on both flights and I was actually expecting worse conditions after reading some reviews before the flight. The seats were indeed suitable, especially since I'm a bit overweight. There was wifi on board both flights however I did not use it. The entertainment system did not have as many choices as on other airlines, but the fact that I did not see any advertising made everything a pleasant experience. The airport in Taipei was a bit crowded, but the lounge was nice, clean, properly supplied and overall the experience was very good.",1
"  Singapore to Warsaw via Paris. I was surprised by the new Boeing 777 interior. It's very modern and comfy. Full HD IFE is great, however there aren't many Hollywood movies, mostly french. Food was delicious, but the portion was rather small. During the flight drinks and snacks were available. On the way from Paris to Warsaw there was only a drink and small cake. In my opinion it's too little for a full service airline as Air France.",1
  Flew Emirates from Bangkok to Dubai. I enjoyed my flight. Check in and boarding was quite easy. The service was very friendly. Perhaps they could have offered some more food after take off when drinks were served given it was a 6 hour flight. All they offered was a small savoury snack. Breakfast however was excellent. The A380 was very comfortable.,1
"  
My outbound flight was from Singapore to Oslo via Doha. The transfer at Doha was a rush because the flight from Singapore was delayed. I had to board a bus to get to the terminal, go through security screening and run across the terminal to the boarding gate to catch another bus for the connecting flight. They failed to transfer my check-in luggage at Doha. I arrived in Oslo at about 1.30pm and reported that my luggage was missing. The ground handling (SAS) representative told me that my luggage was  in Doha and that it would arrive the next day. It did not arrive the next day. I tried calling their representative at the airport, but I could not reach them.  No one from Qatar Airways or SAS called me, even though they have details of my hotel and phone number. Eventually, my luggage was delivered to my hotel 55 hrs after I arrived in Oslo. I have written emails to the airline to ask how I can claim compensation, but each time I only received a reply saying that the matter is being handled by their airport counterparts and to wait for these airport personnel to reply. It has been 17 days since the incident, and there has been no word from these people. ",0
"  Flew Incheon to Singapore. The best thing that Korean Air offered was a rather comfortable seat with ample leg space. Inflight entertainment and food were decent, albeit not the best. Flight attendants were rather polite and helpful, although I was rather unhappy that the flight attendant serving me failed to enquire me on my preferred choice for dinner. There were 3 meal options - A, B, and C. For option B, we could choose between beef and chicken. Instead of listing them out for me, like she did for the passengers next to me, the attendant took the shortcut by asking if I was okay with option B. On hearing yes, she handed me a serving of option B with chicken in it, showing no interest at all that I might be more keen on having beef instead.",1
"  Vienna to Riyadh via Istanbul. Biggest problem with this airline is its home airport. Istanbul Ataturk has huge capacity problems. Because of that most flights are delayed and there are no places to sit while waiting for a delayed flight. Then really amateur services kick in when the employees start calling for all passengers to group in the back of the room for passport check only to move again to the front after that for the boarding. The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience. This was not a low-cost flight, but services appeared so. Food and on-board services won't fix these problems.",0
"  Flew Barcelona to Goa via Doha. We booked seats but the plane class changed, meaning we did not have seats in place where we booked. The entertainment system was good with excellent choice. The food was the same for each leg of flight and was poor quality.",1
"  Singapore to Melbourne. I have not yet taken the flight but the customer service is horrible, I regularly have to wait up to 30 minutes to be talk to a representative for any purpose. I am trying to reschedule my ticket for a solo trip (10 days) from April 2020 to June 2020, which supposedly should not cost me any change fees for changes up to 30 June (as per the first representative I spoke to) because of the COVID-19 outbreak, but this is not reflected on the 'Manage My Booking'. I've been on hold for the part 31 minutes, waiting to speak to the representative, and this isn't the first time I've waited this long. Most accommodation and travel websites are allowing full refunds (like Airbnb, bless them), whereas I was kindly informed by Emirates that they would still charge me SG$400 for cancellation despite the extenuating circumstance that neither is my fault nor something anyone could have seen coming (As of 16th March, Australia's government implemented a 2-week isolation period for all international passengers, making it financially infeasible to make the trip). Customer service is beyond horrific, don't expect any sort of good treatment or understanding of your situation.",0
"  Budapest to Rabat via Paris. In Budapest I was requested to leave my hand luggage to be checked through to Rabat. I've tried to obtain some explanation from the ground staff, they didn't offered me any sort of logic explanation, they just said that they need to checked in. The service from Budapest to Paris was really disappointing. In Paris there were 40 min delay, no explanation. Seats in the flight to Rabat were dirty, food average. One positive thing about the flight was the cabin crew, very friendly. If I would have recommended or flying again with Air France, only if there is no other option, otherwise I will avoid in the future.",0
  London to Bangkok via Dubai. Such a terrible service. Not sure if they even know the word customer service. Couldn’t check in online due their website not letting me and one I finally managed to check in at the airport I’m put on Standby. After speaking to several airline team members from Checkin desk all the way through no solution was offered at all. Even worse I was pretty much told tough luck and try once you get there.,0
"  Perth to Singapore. Dirty tray table, bad cabin crew, poor special meal. During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didn't do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight, the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal, and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency? Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away.",0
"  I noticed that Qatar Airways take good care of passengers more than passengers themselves with an utmost effort to treat every passenger as if he was the only passenger on the flight. Their safety measures especially during COVID-19 crisis is so professional yet so comfortable. I always used to travel business class especially for long distance but once I tried their economy class, honestly not a big difference cause both are considered high class to me.",1
"  Gatwick to Istanbul. Terrible Check in counter at Gatwick South Terminal, not aware of latest rules, lack of professional competence, lack of knowledge, not focusing on client.",0
" Bangkok to Hong Kong. Overall quality is steady from a possible early checking (3h30) to the lounge, plane and service onboard The only thing is within this short 2h30 flight, you don’t have the chauffeur service.",1
  My flight from Sydney to Doha was delayed for 16 hours because of technical problems.  The staff said I'd get my accommodation and transport fees covered but I have got nothing. I had to spend an extra night of layover in Doha and I got no hotel arrangement even though Sydney staff said I would. I would not have taken the delayed flight if I knew U had to suffer an overnight at Doha airport. ,0
"  I bought a very cheap return flight from HKG to CDG via IST for my summer holiday. There was one minor schedule change before the outbound flight but this wasn't inconvenient (departure was brought forward by 40 minutes). Document checks at the check-in counter and the gate were efficient. Upon boarding the aircraft, the crew handed out a Covid hygiene kit that included a quality face mask, small bottle of gel and some wipes. Turkish Airlines is making a big play of its safety precautions, with dedicated videos and the kit. The crew were professional and friendly. Dinner and breakfast were very good - main meals come with a small serving of hummus, which is very pleasant. Transfer at Istanbul airport was easy and worry-free. The IST-CDG flight was packed, but service standards were still good. On the basis of flights flown, Turkish Airlines didn't disappoint. My return flight scheduled on August 7 was first subject to a ""schedule change"" to August 22 four days before departure and then cancelled altogether, which obliged me to make alternative arrangements - which I was going to do anyway to navigate the constantly changing Hong Kong entry and quarantine requirements. Hopefully there will be a partial refund at some stage.",1
"  I flew from Amsterdam to Phuket (return Bangkok to Amsterdam) via Doha in Business Class. All in all a very satisfactory experience. Ground crew in Amsterdam did a wonderful job despite long queues at the security check. At BKK business class passengers could use the fast track through security and immigration. From check in to lounge in 20 minutes. I had 2 flights in the marvellous qsuite. It provides maximum privacy. The other flights were also very good as all seats provided privacy, sleeping comfort and aisle access. The cabin crew provided excellent service on all flights. It's was truly a premier experience.",1
"  My mom and I recently flew from Taipei to Los Angeles with EVA Air, on Tuesday, August 15th 2017. Flight BR12. Boarding at 19:20. During this flight, everything was impeccable, food was delicious, and the flight attendants were very friendly. However, the one thing that stuck out to me the most was, while my mom and I were going through security, she accidentally left her camera bag at security, and did not realize she left it until we were boarding the plane. We decided to go back to the restaurant we ate at, to see if it was there, and it wasn't. So, we decided to just leave the bag and board our plane, since we were already late. While sprinting to our gate to make it in time, she asked some flight attendants to see if they could help her find it and deliver it to LA, where we would land. And they called back to security, and helped us track our bag, and even had the plane wait 7 minutes. Thank you for helping us track our bag, and for being extremely patient with us.",1
"  Seoul to London. Pleasant in-flight attendants and good quality food. However, the seats are somewhat out of date and the airport check in staff, even in the Premium Check In Zone is very rude.",0
"  Bangkok to New York via Hong Kong / Vancouver. Great staff on ground and in air. On my previous trip to NYC it got canceled due to airlines fault and was given compensation and rebooked via another airline (Etihad via Abu Dhabi), during whole process was shown respect and patience, can't be easy dealing with hundreds of angry travelers screaming but ground crew did an amazing job. On this flight: the check in process was quick and efficient and boarding was organized and fast. We left 10 minutes ahead of schedule going to Hong Kong on the A350. The connection at Hong Kong was alright, nothing special. The next segment was to New York JFK via quick stopover/security screening in Vancouver. During this flight the seats were very comfortable for the 12 hour flight and entertainment had plenty to chose from. The meal service was some of the best I've experienced and was offered snacks and drinks throughout the flight. The crew were very attentive and quick in their service. Overall great experience with Cathay Pacific!",1
" Manchester to Istanbul via Bangkok. Flew from Manchester to Bangkok via Istanbul the first flight from Manchester to Istanbul was in economy and whilst I was upset at not being upgraded as I believe I should have nevertheless it was a great experience. The cabin crew were lovely, the food was very good and the cabin comfort was good. The second flight from Istanbul to Bangkok which was upgraded to business class was outstanding. The cabin crew were friendly and they worked very hard due to a full cabin. But it's the food which was outstanding, plentiful and very tasty. My only negative comment about this flight relates to the out of date seating layout of a 2-2-2 configuration. I much prefer a 1-2-1 layout. Other than than I was delighted with my flights. Very highly recommended",1
"  Terrible. When booking seats on the airline’s website, it was shown that row 24E would have extra leg room. Therefore I purchased it for 34USD extra. However, upon boarding of the plane it showed that row 24E was actually behind row 23 (the actual row with the extra leg room) and they refused to compensate for the cost when contacted about this error. Never booking with Turkish Airlines again. Also very stingy and charged for wifi even on long flights.",0
"  Doha to Geneva. Excellent service from start to finish. I heard great reviews about this airline before, but I felt it with above and beyond what I was expecting. It’ll be my first choice airline to fly with going forward.",1
  Horrible experience with Turkish Airlines ground staff. The worse customer service. We were Flying from Ljubljana via Istanbul to Qatar with layover in Istanbul for 12:05h. When I went to customer service information desk and inquire about my entitlement for the layover time the agent was very rude and she told me that my layover is only 11:45h and I only can get a food vouchers. I try to prove that she is wrong but she refuse to listen to me and she stand up and start argument with me asking me what is my problem. My husband who stood behind start to record her behavior as well the behavior of the supervisor who I ask to speak with. The supervisor refuse to talk to me and she literally send out of the counter two man who came to my husband face and start to threaten to us “if you don’t erase immediately video they will call police and as well we will deboard you from next flight”. They not only push in to my husband face they did the same with me and make our child cry who was terrified watching the scene. One of the man ask me for the flight tickets and when I handed over to him he rip them ... there was a lot going on until we decide to erase video that capture their misbehavior. ,0
"  This airline is an absolute nightmare. I do not recommend it to anyone. If you get a hold of customer service every single representative will have a different answer for you. I called to ask about changes to a flight for my husband and I together.  I only wanted to know the cost before booking. In the process the representative booked my husband's flight for a different date without permission. The call then dropped and I had no idea he did this. I waited for the representative to call back and he did not. I called back and told them my ticket number to find out ""your husband's flight has been booked for July 6th now"" I was shocked. I told them that I did not make this change and they told me to put in a feedback form complaint. For which I have not heard back. I told them I do not want the change. We want to fly together as per the July 10th flight. They made us pay more $$$ just to change the flight back to the original. If I did not pay $$$ within 72 hours they would cancel his flight and there would be no refund no nothing. This airline is so lost its unbelievable. They're all on different pages. Every time I call to get any kind of information they all give me different answers! Every time you call it is like a lottery system, you never know what the response will be. One person will tell you ""You can change your flight for 3 dollars"" while another person will say ""The flight change will be $300 dollars."" One person will say ""Fully refundable you get all your money back"" another will say ""Penalty on each ticket"". One person will say ""Refund will process on to your card in 1 week"". Another person will say ""The refund will be only in cash and will take 2-3 months and you have to pick up."" How will I pick up if I am leaving the country? Nothing adds up with this terrible company. I advise you to stay away. We are cancelling both my husband and my ticket although we will lose money just so we will not have to fly with this airline. We are even cancelling our Istanbul trip as I cannot stand traveling with these people or dealing with them anymore.",0
"  My first time travelling with my family to Europe with Qatar Airways and it was long route from Sydney to Paris via Doha and I was grateful that I flew with this airline. Despite the long flight duration, it was a truly comfortable journey for me and my family. The seats and on-board services from the staffs were excellent. The foods were by far the best in-flight meals that I ever had. I was impressed of how Qatar prioritise child passenger and how the staffs interact with kid so sincerely. Transit in Doha was OK, nice airport but not many options for foods. But it was OK because the flight service gave us everything that we need. The only disappointment was the ground staff in Sydney airport. We were denied check in the flight to Paris because I had a Schengen visa issued by Switzerland. But the manager in-charged sorted it.",1
" Shameful exploitation. As a seasoned world traveller, I have flown with pretty much all of the main carriers, and I’m pretty sure I flew with Cathay Pacific around 23 years ago to Singapore. So for my upcoming trip to Phuket via Hong Kong we chose to fly with them again (not much choice to be honest!). Having paid a considerable amount of money to fly with Cathay Pacific this time around, I was horrified and extremely disappointed that to reserve seats so that my wife and I could sit together on the 4 flights I had to pay £197.60. This is absolutely daylight robbery! How can they justify this much money for reserving 2 seats! It costs them nothing… they have already taken 1000’s of pounds for my flights and there is no additional administration needed because its all done via computer (if fact I received confirmation of my reserved seats straight after I’d paid the additional £197.60). It seems to me that they are exploiting a captive audience and playing on the fear of their travellers not being able to sit together on these long haul flights. Shame on you Cathay Pacific! This will be the last time I ever fly with CP, and I will make it my mission in life to inform my many 1000’s of contacts worldwide to do the same! Note: The date of my flight is the 5th of March 2024, so that I could leave this review I chose todays date.",0
 Singapore to Colombo with Singapore Airlines. The check in has been fully automated. You have to tag your own baggage and no staff is around to assist. Crew is quite rude and didn't care much about the passengers. Food is bland and the service is not that good. Wouldn't recommend. I think Singapore Airlines is losing its quality.,0
"  It is unbelievable how the managers of Turkish Airlines managed to find a tricky way to receive cash and exploit the poor customers in pain to find a way to get to their homes during the startup of the pandemic. Turkish Airlines was one of the very few companies still allowing people around the world to look and book for flights, they would apply full charge to the credit card for flights which they knew would never be allowed to take off. Few days before departure they would claim COVID state restrictions to cancel the flight and offer all kind of compensations except of returning the stolen cash. I have tried to apply for standard refund (money back) from MAY to SEPTEMBER and initially they were asking to wait 2 months after flight restrictions have been lifted and after it happened they now answer they won t take any request of refund which is filed later than August 16th. Customers do not have any mean to defend their rights, the airline can only be contacted via contact form, the last one i have submitted did not even get a reply. I hope this is the last money the airline could unlawfully steal from poor users.",0
"  I decided to fly Emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago. Well what I can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline. Some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless. What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines. I would say Emirates is still a viable option if the price is right and they offer a lot of connections, but they are not my first choice airlines if other middle eastern carriers are in the game.",1
"  Seoul to Toronto. The staff is efficient, fast and friendly. The food is excellent.  Korean air is my favorite one. Even the boarding is amazing.",1
" We had an exceptional flight with Emirates from Düsseldorf to Dubai. The service on board was on point, the staff were friendly and helpful. The A380 was modern and it offered a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment was amazing and offered a lot of new movies. Only the wifi on board was a negative on this flight.",1
"  I had an unpleasant trip back to Singapore from Hong Kong. Firstly, the boarding time was 7.15pm. We ended up boarding at 7.30pm. Secondly, the cabin crew were not that friendly. Thirdly, the whole entertainment system was down about 3/4 of the time. Yes, they compensated us with a $75 gift voucher but the fact is this was my first time with Singapore Airlines and there were so many problems. Before take off, the TV that was supposed to show us the safety procedure was disrupted by a technical error. The food was not that tasty compared to Korean Air (who I was flying from Korea to Hong Kong). The ticket I bought was cheap but I believe service could be better.

"  Apart from my Mileage Plus problem, the IFE, crew attitude and food were amazing. They mostly gave me Salmon for my seafood meals. They were also willing to answer to my curiosity about the laughter coming from the rear galley. Another problem encountered was the Wi-Fi because I had to pay for it. However, neither the Wi-Fi nor my Mileage Plus problems were as big as the problem encountered in 2014. I can say, quite a big improvement in service from 2016. All in all, the problems (Mileage Plus & Wi-Fi) were much smaller",1
 Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City via Hong Kong. One of the best airlines I have flown with. Bit pricey but you get what you pay for. Cathay Pacific has really great customer service. Seats very comfortable and I slept like a baby. Leg room very sufficient and a great food menu on-board. Up there with Singapore Airlines to be honest. Would highly recommend.,1
"  Chicago to Dubai. First time flying Emirates business class and was excited to try it but very disappointed after my experience. No greeting by any of the staff even the check in staff. I got the middle seat and felt very claustrophobic. If you are also going as a couple or with a friend, it’s hard to carry a conversation with the person you are flying next to since the divider in between doesn’t even go down completely. On a long plane ride, this is very frustrating that you cannot even carry a proper conversation or see the person next to you. In terms of the service, the stewardess serving me was lazy and made me hand her all the trays and hand myself all the plates rather than setting it down directly on the table. I thought this is very unsafe since some dishes are very hot. She was also too lazy to make the bed for me so I had to do it myself. Not only that but one of the stewardesses left the tray on the seat in front of us which crashing down in front of my boyfriends feet during the middle of the flight. The head flight attendant walking by noticed it and didn’t even apologize and rather asked us abruptly what had happened like it was our fault his staff left the tray there. There are also no slippers or pajamas offered like other flights. The food is also not personalized and not very good. They didn’t even offer us dessert and when we asked for it, they assumed someone had already taken our order and didn’t give us the dessert. Most of all, the airport lounge in Dubai on the way to another city is really outdated, basic and unimpressive. It’s really long and big but composed of the same basic food drinks and no amenities other than a few shower rooms. The spa which was on the map was closed and half the loung was also closed when we were there for no reasons given. All the other major airlines business class I had taken including cathay, Singapore airlines, korean air and Etihad had much better lounges. I especially expected more since Emirates is Dubai’s flagship carrier but it looks like they cut costs severely. Would not take Emirates again although I already bought several more tickets for the rest of the leg of this trip that I cannot cancel. Some positives were chauffeur service, private entrance at gate for customs and security check in the Dubai airport, and the entertainment system on the plane which had a lot of movies. However the WiFi was very slow,  overall very disappointed.",0
"  Hong Kong to Seoul Incheon in 2017. The ground staff allowed me to check in despite that it was 5.5 hours before departure. A330-300  was quite full but it did not hamper the cabin crew effort to maintain high level of service. Peanuts and cold beverages were served. Meal was served approximately 30 minutes after take off followed by hot beverages. This aircraft is fitted with the newer version CX studio. There are wide selection of entertainment, movies and music on board. The 3D flight map is also available. As it is a flight bound for Seoul, Korea, the airline assigned Korean speaking crew. Overall in flight service is above average, though a little more attention can be focus on the in flight catering,",1
" Istanbul to Tashkent. Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space. Transit through Visa control and baggage collection was fast by Uzbek standards.",1
"  Singapore to Munich. Check in was great, straight up to the desk. Used the business class lounge which was good to have a bite to eat and relax. This aircraft had the new business class seat and the reviews are right - it is the best business seat I've come across. Heaps of room and your own little compartment. Had 3 course meal before bed. The bed was great with myself 6'4 being able to totally lay stretched out and get hours of sleep. Booked the cook and had the full English breakfast before landing. Couldn't fault this flight one bit.",1
"  London to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Earlier flight cancelled, long delay in airport. Booked window flights on cancelled flight and we have middle aisle seats now. Food on flight from Perth to Hong Kong was awful. Won't be flying Cathay Pacific again - 5 star, I don't think so. ",0
"  Excellent way to fly between Europe and Brazil. The aircraft is now firmly my favourite, the route between Europe and Sao Paulo is always bumpy, but the A350 seems to be the best at ironing out as much of the turbulence as possible, the previous ""best"" was the 777-300 but the A350 seems substantially more comfortable in bad weather. Air France uses this aircraft on this route, the cabin appears to be brand new, the screens are really nice. The economy seat is a little hard but no more so than any other economy seat. As Platinum flying blue I am able to choose for free my seat so I was able to peg a seat at the front of economy so I had a) extra legroom and b) I was able to disembark earlier than most which is huge when queues for immigration control are already long enough. Dinner was poor last night, chicken with mash and a mushroom sauce, generally its better, breakfast looked nice, but I do not like eggs (not their fault). Staff on the flight were really good, very supportive to a passenger next to me who was very nervous, came and thanked me as a Platinum member for my custom, its not necessary but still a nice touch. Flight was on time leaving and early arriving, was a really good price with a no catches refund policy which is really great in this pandemic situation. Other than the Chicken and Mash they didn't put a foot wrong.",1
"  Very disappointing experience. I booked a one way flight for $2000 Email confirmation was not sent till I called emirates three days later after my booking. I am 6’5 feet tall and have bad knees. After boarding, there were at least 3 empty seats at the emergency exit in economy class, I asked the crew if I could change my seat to one the emergency exit empty seat. The reply was you need to pay $200 extra for that. I explained why I need to move to a seat with more leg space and that it’s still an economy seat that no one is using, they simply said sorry we can’t. The whole flight I was shivering and when I asked for an extra blanket the reply was sorry everyone is asking for extra blanket. I has a much better experience with other airlines. Emirates is so overrated unless you are booking on business or first class.",0
"  Dhaka to Dublin via Istanbul. For my flight from Dhaka to Istanbul the flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft in Dhaka, and was approx 2 hours late in arriving at Istanbul. When I asked a crew member about the delay and what I can do upon arrival in Istanbul as I would not make my connecting flight he became extremely aggressive, he displayed the same attitude to other concerned customers on the flight. In Istanbul they arranged a hotel, but I found both the customer service service staff and the hotel booking staff to be extremely rude and unwilling to answer questions. I was approx 24hrs late in arriving at my final destination. They informed us that our pick up from the hotel for the rearranged flight was to be at 03:00am but the bus did not arrive until 03:30am. No apology was ever offered for any of the delays. I tried writing to Turkish Airlines but no joy, they are not in the least helpful or apologetic and their complaints procedure must be deliberately designed to frustrate aggrieved passengers. Last time I shall fly Turkish as I am concerned with the attitude of their staff and their aggressive behaviour.",0
"  I had a very bad experience with this company. Booked a flight and had to cancel - cancelled within 1 hour from booking - was promised I would get a refund within 24h but never received any refund. After more than a month and at least 20 calls to customer service later, I received 280 dkk instead of 284.93 euro that i paid for the tickets. This equals 38 euros out of the total of 284.93 euro! After this I called the customer service about 10 times and each time had to explain what happened and each time I was promised they would correct it yet it took me 10 phone calls to have a case created and after that i have not heard anything for a month. Today I called again and was promised the agent would follow up and call me today - noone called hence I called again. I was transferred to another department that never answered the phone hence I called again and the lady could not even send me an email stating when I would get the remaining of my money back. She only said that she thinks that I will have to wait for 3 more weeks which means after more than 2 months of waiting for a reimbursement that was supposed to be executed within 24h - in best case scenario I will have to wait for 3 months. I was a happy AF customer but now with this bad customer service, I will go elsewhere.",0
  I believe Qatar Airways is the best airways with affordable price however they sell tickets with shorter layover and may change the flight layover time. They do offer cancellation options but that’s just the game.  I always try to fly on Qatar Airways but if it’s uncertain I will think twice before I buy it’s tickets again.,1
"  Manila to Taipei. Very fast and efficient flight. There's just this air of professionalism from them I felt during the whole flight. Whether it's before the trip or during, it's so efficient that I'm using that word over and over again. Well trained and personable staff. Food was I'd say standard and IFE I don't even recall to really comment. Counter check in was smooth in Taiwan in our return flight but very long in Manila. Very good experience. What this special was we were able to get a very goo price because of a promo so it's probably one of the best value trips I've flown.",1
"  Cluj-Napoca to Singapore via Istanbul and it was one of the best flight experiences so far. You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight. All in all, very happy with the airline, their call center (which I used to reserve my seats) and would gladly fly with them again. .",1
"  Flew Air France from Paris to Shanghai. This was probably one of the best flights I have had. First of all, ground services were very careful and warned me about some delays unrelated to this airline. The new Air France Business Class is done with good taste and comfort. The seat becomes a real bed and the seat configuration enables passangers to have access to the aisle without bothering other passangers. The catering was outstanding. Food tasted the way it should taste. The selection of drinks and wines were remarkable. Crew were polite and professional, yet discreet.",1
"  New York to Chiang Mai return via Singapore booked for March 2017. Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit. But if you say okay to these choices ""you could end up with any one of them"", and all are inferior to the original reservation. I cancelled, and will not be booking this airline again. This magnitude of change is inexcusable and the subsequent policy absurd.",0
"  Barcelona to Paris CDG. Ticket was purchased on Delta in early November with the BCN-CDG-MIA segments for travel in AF premium economy. When I tried to check in online it was not available for check-in; a phone call to Delta said that I was now flying JOON ex-BCN, in economy class. When I finally got to check in online via the AF site, I was offered a business class upgrade BCN-CDG for 480 euros (promptly refused). Flight was completely full with constant announcements promoting Joon as the innovative airline. Not quite – more like any other LCC. There is no seat entertainment, an app must be downloaded. Only coffee, tea, and water are complimentary, everything else is for sale. When I commented that I was on a premium economy fare the flight attendant’s response was no, it’s not offered and too bad for me. Unfortunately it seems AF is spreading this busline of theirs to numerous cities in Europe and that will impact selecting Air France for travel.",0
"  This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.",1
"  Emirates just won my worst airline experience. I was supposed to fly the simple Manila-Dubai-Washington route. But instead, I got Manila-Clark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. We then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. Eventually, we left at 2AM after a 8 hour delay. Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made. Those that ticketed me in Clark airport in the Philippines was not even an Emirates staff. ",0
"  Flew Istanbul to Hurghada. Convenient airside access through the lounge appreciated. The lounge offering good range of food and beverage options late into the night. Could do with some variations though. Orderly boarding process with pre-flight announcements and priority enforcement. Was upgraded due to overbooking which was a nice surprise. Full cabin. The crew were excellent. Pre take off drinks, a nice breakfast with two warm choices and after meal drinks service provided. Handed out tablets with pre-loaded entertainment and good quality headphones for this 2.5 hour hop on this A321 with empty middle seat configured J Cabin. Very smooth landing despite rough weather and on time arrival. Kudos to the flight-deck. Excellent overall flying experience with Turkish Airlines on this journey.",1
"  Ho Ch Minh to Singapore. Everything went good except for the entertainment overall. Check in was not that crowded. Security check at SGN was well organized. Boarding was efficient and we’re one of the last onboard. Flight departed on time and we get good choice of food containing Fish and rice onboard with another drinks served, they are all delicious. However the entertainment was below the standard of Emirates. The staff we’re good onboard. Overall, still a great flight with Singapore Airlines.",1
" On arrival at check in at Gatwick we were informed that on our flight to Istanbul, we could not sit in the exit seats that we had paid for in advance due to our age. However, on our flight from Istanbul to Amman we could sit on the exit seats although our age hadn’t changed. Absolutely ridiculous and furious as we had paid for our seats in good faith. The flight itself was fine as was the food. In our seats were teenagers who would more likely panic if they had to open the exit door. My husband and I are fit and healthy and better equipped to deal with this. Will not be using Turkish Airlines again after the end of this trip.",0
"  Christchurch to Bangkok via Singapore. Was upgraded from Premium Economy to Business for first leg, and flew Economy on second. First time flying Singapore and for the most part I was satisfied, but expected it to be much better. The hard product was fine, comfortable business class seats, good food and plenty of IFE options. Service could use improvement, had a short connection in Singapore but the gate number was not provided until about 1 hour before landing. After ""running"" to the gate, there was no plane or staff there, not even any signage informing of new gate. Had to search on my phone only to find out it was changed to opposite side of the terminal. Again had to run to new gate and boarded just in time.",1
"  Cathay’s economy class offering has really gone down hill. On the packed flight from Hong Kong to Sydney, the toilets were in a disgusting state from early in the flight. The chief flight attendant gave the wrong information to passengers - that only one Australian customs/immigration form was needed per family (instead of one form per passenger). And when the plane had arrived in Sydney, and all the passengers were waiting for their bags, a series of announcements were made to say that all the bags were still inside the plane’s hold, and the airline did not know when they would be released. Our bags came out within an hour, but were among the early ones. ",0
"  We had our tickets canceled due to COVID a year ago and we still can't get our refund back. They withdrew the money and do not want to return it. During the year they said we had to wait a little longer and they would return everything and 12 months had passed. Terrible customer service, always say the same thing and then just hang up. It is better to spend more money than to order tickets from them again",0
" Great flight for an intra-european flight from London Heathrow to Istanbul. Used the mobile app for check in and had hand baggage only so whizzed through terminal 2 at LHR. Refreshing to have a proper 'full service' airline within Europe. Free hot meal and drink, free IFE, free baggage check in. Very comfortable seat with ample legroom. Flight was on time, crew were friendly. Very satisfied.",1
"  Auckland to Manchester via Dubai. Never travelling with this airline again. They clearly overbooked, and delayed my mums flight by 10 hours, whilst my flight was still ok to go ahead. Used the excuse ""Not enough time to board on the transfer"" but for some reason my fight was ok. We were booked to go on the same flights. Had my mum waiting 10 hours in the airport, with no complementary food. Not impressed with the service at all. Customer Service Helpdesk is based in India, so good luck, if you ever have issues with them. ",0
"  Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce.  We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly? ",0
"  Very smooth flights, operated by J-Air. Online check-in and even check-in at the airport using the normal booking reference number were not available (these flights were booked using Qantas points). However, the counter staff at both locations were efficient and found the reservation quickly. The boarding by zones process worked well, and onboard service of drinks was friendly. The seat was a little narrow. The flights operated exactly on time and baggage was quick to appear. Compared to a recent JAL Business Class domestic flight, the service, beverage and check-in process were identical and it's hard to see why one would take JAL Business Class within Japan.",1
"  Hong Kong to Copenhagen in 2018. The seat is quite comfortable. The space isn't too narrow and the headrest is soft and  comfortable. The personal television is large and there is many movies, TV, music and games provided. The personal television can clearly show where are we and the basic info. of the plane(speed and attitude etc.). The meal includes the main course, ice-cream, salad and drinks. It is quite delicious.",1
"  Both flights Stuttgart-Paris and Paris-Chicago were on time. The short-haul flight was operated by ""Cityjet for Air France"" and uneventful. The long-haul flight was operated on a quite dated A330-200, there were still ashtrays built onto the armrests and the seats were very narrow. There were individual screens, however, these were old too: small, responded slowly, and it took 1.5h and two resets until the entertainment system in the aircraft finally worked. The catering was average. We liked, however, that even in economy class you can get champagne. The flight attendants seemed genuinely friendly and did they work very well.

"  Doha to Munich. As a solo traveller I hate their 2-2-2 configuration in the Boeing 777, which they fly from Amsterdam. To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger.  This was the second plane change for the worse in 5 months.",0
"  Philadelphia to Doha, and more complete disregard for Privilege Club Platinum members. Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there. I waited for nearly an hour in the airport QR office for the staff to come after seeing off the flight that I came in on.",1
"  Let me start by saying that the flight wasn’t practicing social distancing at all. The seats were full with everyone sitting next to each other, people not wearing face masks and the worst thing was that a lady with a child started changing the diaper while people are eating, the smell just made me throw up. Not one of the flight attendant cared what the passenger was doing or asked to take it to the washroom,  very unprofessional employees. We are in a pandemic and they fill up the flight with people from every county! Never flying with them again, disgusting flight, they don’t even have lactose fiber or gluten free food for passengers who need that option.",0
"  Taipei to San Francisco via Seoul Incheon. Very friendly crew, enjoyed my flight even with some delay at Incheon airport due to bad weather. The crew asked the passenger in the front to keep the chair straight during meals, which was very nice because when passengers ask each other, it doesn’t always work well. Will definitely travel with Korean Air again!",1
" First time flying Qatar in any class and I have to say I am impressed. Check-in was a bit slow but with all the paper work required it was to be expected. For what ever reason we were denied access to the lounge even though we paid for the full fare ticket, ended up using the priority pass instead. Lounge was average and if it wasn’t free I doubt I would bother. Boarding started on time with priority for business class given and we were soon seated. Welcome drink offered HD seat explained. Unfortunately QR have stopped offering Q suites from Munich, can’t be lack of demand as the flight was full. Staff were incredibly friendly and always on hand, nothing was too much trouble. Flight left and arrived on time.",1
"  Kuwait To Munich Via Doha. The Kuwait To Doha flight was operated on an a bit old but good  A330-300, The Doha To Munich was operated on a great Boeing B777-300ER. Starting from the short 50 minute KWI—>DOH Flight, it was great! Good and comfortable aircraft, screens were a bit outdated on the A330, but still has the latest oryx one movies. the legroom was fantastic, however window seats only have an IFE Box under each seat blocking legroom. Service on that short flight was great! Cabin crew were very nice, beautiful deep blue mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere Inside the cabin, and the flight was On-Time. Connection In Doha was super easy, smooth and efficient, beautiful super modern airport with great toilets,  range of shops and restaurants, and very nice staff. Boarding Started few minutes after the landing from Kuwait, so we rushed to our next flight to Munich.  Second flight  was operated on a new  and very comfortable Boeing B777-300ER, as much as people complained about the 10 abreast 777, I found it to be actually good! Legroom was amazing, Seat recline was excellent! NO IFE box under the seat blocking legroom on the B777. On demand high resolution screens, beautiful mood lighting, with nice refreshing towels being distributed. What Impressed me the most Is the Qatar Airways New Super WiFi!  I was told that it was the fastest and best In the Air. Even a YouTube video would be played. And  WiFi Is  cheap on Qatar Airways! 30 Minutes for free, and only 10USD for the duration of the flight, no matter how long. The OryxOne Inflight Entertainment System was excellent and offered a lot of great movies and TV Shows! After departure the snack service commenced, they served a Quisine savory snack sandwiches, it was very good, much better snacks then what they used to serve before. It was a good chicken pizza sandwich, not the dry chicken sandwiches they used to serve. Since It was a night flight,  Cabin lights were dimmed Into mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere onboard, the crew kept serving beverages every 30 minutes, they were very nice and helpful. Few hours later , they served breakfast, I ordered a special Hindu Meal request, It was delicious, at least better than the normal meal they serve. ;) That wasn’t my first time flying Qatar Airways, but I really have to say Qatar Airways has Improved a lot since my last flight with them almost 9 months ago. Much Better, cheaper and faster WiFi, better savory snacks, better breakfasts, better refreshed Oryx Entertainment System. Looking forward for my return flight with Qatar Airways again soon.",1
"  My flight was cancelled but Turkish Airlines did not refund my money yet. The ticket sales office at Budapest airport suggested to write an email as they are just a sales office. The phone no. of (closed) hungarian office cannot be reached. After 20 emails, 7 formal feedback requests on int site and 8 calls with int customer representatives still 0 update. Worst airline I came across.",0
  Singapore to Taipei. The flight was in good condition. Flight attendants were generally attentive although more smile will be good. The one who attended to me was not that friendly. Flight entertainment was limited.  Food was okay although I expected more. Generally quite a decent flight both ways. Leg room is quite standard. Toilets are clean. Inflight Wifi is not free. ,1
"  Trip Routing - Manila - Haneda - Vancouver - May 2016. ANA Deserves their 5 star rating. Manila airport Terminal 3 is a bit chaotic but check in line moves quickly and agents are fast and efficient. The true experience begins when you are greeted at the aircraft door by the wonderful flight attendants. The Japanese have mastered the art of ""Customer Service"". FA's are friendly, courteous and with smile that never goes away. Meal service is very efficient as they show in pictures what is being served and all you need to do is point and comes your hot, delicious and well presented meal. On my longer leg, HND-YVR, 2 meal services were offered and there's an in-between snack and drink service all the time. FA's are seen throughout the entire flights. FA's walking up and down the aisle checking on every awake passenger and offering drinks or food. FA's are also on standby in the back area galley and awaiting for any passenger call. I know this because I get up almost every hour to stretch and FA's never failed to ask me if I needed anything. Economy Seats are comfortable and legroom is sufficient. Aircraft is clean and smells fresh.",1
 We flew from Singapore to Manchester on Sunday 28th October and can honestly say it was the best economy flight we have travelled on. Very comfortable seats tasty food and snacks Exceptionally clean toilets and most of all a great cabin crew.,1
  On my flight to Cebu I was covered in bug bites by the end of my flight. On my return flight we were the first ones to check in and the the attendant put my husbands name in twice and erased mine. So we had to wait for 2 1/2 with a child stuck in the check in area. Then they finally fixed it without help we were separated on the flight home and they wouldn’t upgrade one of us. ,0
"  Another good flight with Air France. I booked last minute as my flight with Transavia to Orly was cancelled due to the general strike in France on the 9th of May. Upgraded at the gate to business class. Good collation served, well presented. Service impeccable just like what I have been accustomed to with Air France. Baggage arrived promptly on arrival.",1
"  It was my first experience with Qatar Airways. Although it was a long flight for me from Beirut to Qatar and from Qatar to LA,  it was worth it with the Qatar Airways. The quality, the service, the flexibility, the hospitality, check in were top. Even, I had to change the flight date, they did it without charge. They deserve to be the top airline in the world. I had very good experience. ",1
"  Booked a RT flight from Bologna to Narita via Istanbul. Overall a very good experience, second time flying with THY. The first leg of of the flight is ok. Check in at G. Marconi airport very efficient, boarding though was a bit messy due to some passengers not knowing entrance zones. Meal service is a bit slow, as reasonable attention is given to passengers when attendants ask for meal and drink choices. Transit at Istanbul is organized, with the IST to NRT leg a very pleasant experience. On return, lines at NRT were really long due to previous flight the cancellations in IST. Transit at IST a nightmare, as some passengers were given identical seat numbers due to missed connection. Onboard airline staff handled the situation very well even with the presence of irate customers.",1
"  Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo via Tokyo. This was my first family trip to Sapporo via Tokyo and my first time flying with ANA. No doubt that this airline is a 5 star airlines. From ticket price, check-in, departure (delayed for almost 1 hour on that day), meals, seats (although a bit cramp), everything is up to my satisfaction. Just one thing that I would like to highlight is the good and friendly service from cabin crew service went a little overboard. During meal serving session, cabin crew attending to the same passengers who already have their meals and drinks distributed (these passengers keep on requesting for more drinks) and left the rest of the passengers who have not got their meal and drinks waited.",1
" Exceptional service with this airline. Caring, warm, personable.  I mentioned to the crew that I don't drink alcohol. Not only did they prepare a glass of non-alcoholic champagne for me, they brought and showed me the bottle just to reassure me that the alcohol content was zero percent. Then after the main meal, they came round to tell each of us, ""The service isn't over!""  And many of the ground staff I interacted with were just as impressive. ",1
" Turkish Airlines use to be a good company, COVID is the perfect excuse to lower everything in business class with no sense at all. Business lounge closed. Extremely poor lunch box on 4.5 hour international flight and 1.5 hour domestic flight. You are even not entitled to have a glass of water. We used our last miles for a reward ticket and will move to another company who have the respect of a customer who pays 3 to 5 time more for his flight than in economy.",0
" Singapore to Sydney. The decline in service and product continues from Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy includes plastic glasses, only two wine choices (Red or White) only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airline’s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window. Unless you can book for only 10-15 % more than economy I wouldn’t bother Entertainment is good in its range but the system is unstable. Wifi wouldn’t connect",0
" Istanbul to Paris with Air France. The small A319 was completely full. Friendly crew with new seats in a renovated cabin. Food served was a hot meal (entree, main dish end dessert) with drinks, which is an improvement vs. previous flights. No IFE for the 3h40 flight but AF allows you to download free movies to watch on your tablets 30H before the flight for the whole duration of the trip. This is a nice initiative and was much welcome. Flawless flight and arrival 5' ahead of schedule.",1
"  Singapore to Malta via Istanbul. This is by far the worst business class experience I have had.  Insincere smiles from the stewards/ stewardesses, with zero personal engagement. Zero reaction to air steward call button - and damaged headphone socket so only 1 ear can hear. Removal of headphones 1 hour before landing! Shoddy service - poor reaction, attitude when requesting items - zero smiles.  Hot towels - scorching hot, and overly wet. Food This is frankly the worst part. Non fresh juice! Welcome drinks - is what you get at a children's birthday party. Timing of food i.e. breakfast, the starter served, then bread basket comes some 15 minutes later.  Coffee and tea limited in choice. Breakfast omelette over done and hard. Lots of staff, and even chefs dressed as 'chefs' - but with the food quality simply terrible. Flat bed fine. Movie choices ok - but again on both flights problems with the headphone sockets. Toilets clean. Toiletries bag very average and looks cheap. No communication from the pilot for delayed take off (or even apology). Istanbul airport was amazing I must comment that there was improved service between Istanbul and Malta - both flights but the food quality remained quite poor. I will be avoiding this airline at all cost. Ground service chaotic - with no clear focus on who is business and who is economy. Poor communication around boarding times (in Malta and Istanbul)",0
  I have a excellent experience in this flight. The crew are very accommodating and friendly (Eloisa and Mohamad). Also thanks to Eloisa for referring me the mariner lounge.I have great time staying at Doha airport while waiting for my connecting flight.,1
"  
I had a Qatar voucher. I made a booking for February 2023 but sustained an injury within hours, so I cancelled.

Nowhere in their terms and conditions did it say that they would do this. ",0
  We had an average experience with Turkish Airlines on April 22. We were disappointed that we could not upgrade our seats to Business Class. The legroom in the A321 economy seats were very uncomfortable for a 6 hour journey. We tried to reach out to the call centre in Istanbul to request for an upgrade to Business Class as the flight was an overnight flight between Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was quite awful and would likely will not choose to fly with Turkish Airlines again. ,0

" London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow.",0
  Sydney to Singapore in Economy class. I recently received a status match I am QF platinum and received kris gold. At the airport I proceeded to first class check in (allowed with qf platinum) but did not realise that Kris gold doesn’t provide the same benefit. I was told by the check on supervisor that I was being unfair to other passengers as if I had come to the wrong desk on purpose. She came back again and repeated the same on front of other passengers. The experience was humiliating as I had made a genuine error,0
"  This review is similar to a recent one regarding very slow response time for settling baggage compensation claims. My luggage did not arrive with me on arrival to Washington.

"  My flight was from Nuremberg to Istanbul with an A321.  The flight was a great experience for me. The good start was when I was informed that the airline upgrade itself my seat from economy to business class. I was surprised. When I first got in the aircraft I observed that the Business cabin room was great. There are 2 seats in every side instead of the 3x3 (with a vacant seat in the middle) which is the average. The seat space was quite comfortable, the meal was tasty and I also enjoyed the beverages (fresh orange juice, a home-made lemonade and a glass of white wine). The touch screen gives you the opportunity to reach your destination in a relaxing and calm way.",1
   The boarding was smooth despite the big crowd of passengers and the flight was quite comfortable. The flight attendant who was in charge of our aisle was super nice and charming and behaved like a Disney princess for the children next to me. I forgot to choose the Moslem Meal option so I was not able to eat the breakfast meal as it contained pork and attendant offered me some fruits and yogurt. Overall it was a pleasant flight.,1
"  Auckland to Doha. We had to think about this flight because of the long flight time. Fortunately, in this aircraft slightly wider seats installed and the seat spacing was also increased. The onboard catering was very good and drinks were always distributed by the cabin staff. The plane made a modern and clean impression. As on another long-haul flight, the crew sometimes seemed overwhelmed and uncoordinated .",1

I called Emirates and they said I would be unable to fly back but that they could keep my ticket and place it on hold. When I went to change the date to fly back, they made me pay the fare difference. In this case, the cheapest fare difference I could get within a two week period was $400. How an airline can you charge you for getting covid is insane. I’m so disappointed and upset. Their customer service team on the phone was awful. I will never fly with Emirates again after this experience. I didn’t ask for covid, and got financial punished for it.",0
"  I flew from SFO on Sept 11th 2020 at 6pm to Istanbul with my two daughters and my brother. I was very very disappointed with the services during this long flight. Just one hour after flight they brought a box of food which included a small water, a kid juice, a pastry and a cold very dry cheese sandwich that was very hard to swallow. one hour later they threw a bottle of water at us, Then for eight hours no service. During this eight hours a few people went to the galley including myself and ask for something to eat they said they or out and don't have anything. Again after 8 hours they brought a brown bag which had the same things inside. As we know and understand we are dealing with Covid-19 but this should not be the excuse for this airline to serve this nasty food and cut the service and pocket more money in their pockets. The air plane was 90% full, I am sure they made money. There is nothing wrong with serving hot meals which was all covered up and came from over directly to the passengers. They could easily served small bottles of a wines, alcohol, sodas, hot tea and coffee. If all this are served in the restaurants why not air planes? One the biggest part of traveling and entertainment is food, In the air plane eating good food and good drinks make your time more enjoyable and your travel time goes a lot faster and you always remember the good food. My sister just traveled to Turkey by KLM airline and went through Europe, She could not talk enough about how good the food and the service was. They were served two hot meals, drinks and snacks through out the flight while the flight was only 30% full which for sure the airline is losing money. For sure this was my last flight with Turkish Airline and I don't recommend it to anyone. My family and I travel a lot this was a very bad experience.",0
"  Cape Town to Sao Paulo via Istanbul. We applied and was granted ""free accommodation"" and stay over in Istanbul - never issued. This was a major reason we decided to use them they were not cheaper than SAA (direct flight) and the price we paid was to fly twice longer in and out. I contacted them many times over 9 months and just got promises, 4 days before our departure they still could not issue the vouchers and had to pay all ourselves. No feedback, no communication, nothing.",0
"  Flew EVA Air from London to Bangkok on Elite class. This is not my first time using EVA as they are my preferred choice when flying to BKK or Taipei. The online booking is pretty straight forward but I wish they allow passengers to edit their profile and input passport information prior to check in. I checked in online 24 hours before departure and dropped my luggage at Heathrow. There is never a queue for Elite class passengers which is a plus. Boarding was on time. The plane was 8 years old and has just been refurbished - new seats for Elite class as well as new entertainment system. Personally I think the entertainment system is decent - the screen is large with good resolution, but the programme is limited, and the flight map is not interactive.  I prefer the old seat as it felt more comfortable. However the advantage of the new seat is that the chunky entertainment box has now been removed. They have upgraded the amenity pack but it was just the packing that is changed. Service on this flight was the biggest disappointment. The crew serving my area did not smile once - not a typical EVA standard. Food and wine were ok although I sensed some cost cutting this time. The flight was pretty smooth and we landed on time. ",1
" Medium haul flight from Singapore to Bangkok. The plane was a rather dated B777. Nevertheless, the cabin was well maintained, and the seats were comfortable and offered sufficient legroom. The food was very tasty. However, I was most impressed with the service of the cabin staff. I was wearing a suit, and the flight attendant asked me whether he could put the suit jacket on a hanger, which has never happened to me with any other airline.",1
"  Night flight from Athens to Istanbul. Departed on time. Efficient check in and security procedures. Flight duration of one hour and 40 minutes, during which some light meal was served - consisted of a sandwich and croissant stuffed with cheese and halal meat. Salad and desert were given, as well as refreshments, tea and coffee. All foodstuff was of excellent taste and quality! Very fast and efficient cabin crew, the only minus was their limited ability to speak English. Ear phones were handed out - inflight entertainment was very good considering the time limitation.",1
"  Ahmedabad to New York via Doha. Qatar Airways was the best choice especially during long trip like 13 to 14 hours. Cabin crew very polite, responding and engaging. Food was outstanding. Seats are pretty comfortable and wide enough to stretch your legs. It is the best airline among other airlines I travelled in. I would definitely fly with Qatar airways again.",1
  The food was excellent. The flight left on time. The toilets were clean. The staff were attentive. The seat was very small and legroom was tight. The entertainment system was poor.,0
" I want to give every person who works for this airline a massive hug. Typically, flying economy from New York to Japan is a nightmare at around $900. This was not the case for Japan Airlines–let me count the bidets. They gave us ice cream. They asked me–nearly constantly–if I'd like something else to eat or drink. I had an entire row to myself–as did nearly everyone else on the plane. I slept, I worked. I have to say that–like everything else I know about Japan (very little) the plane exhibited a kind of antiquated futurism. Unlike most modern airplanes, it didn't have a plug for my laptop or really any movies I wanted to see. But that just meant I ended up not having to do too much work and I got to see the ending of Kenneth Branagh's Orient Express. Also, the bathroom lavatory has a heated toilet seat. ",1
"  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze). Overall, it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition.",1
"  Mumbai to Copenhagen via Doha. For the BOM-DOH segment the aircraft was equipped with the Qsuites configuration. The attention to detail in the Q-seat design is admirable. For seat comfort and privacy, this is closer to First Class on several other airlines. For the DOH-CPH segment, the aircraft had the traditional Business Class seating. Even here, the Qatar Airways seat affords a great deal of comfort and space. Service levels were exceptional and the cabins spotless. My verdict: Qatar Airways Business Class is 'the best of the best.' The competition is not even close.",1
" Helsinki to Kiev via Istanbul. Flying Turkish Airlines for the very first time. I was simply shocked, in a good way. I have never seen a more spacious plane with such leg room in economy class. The served meal was just lovely, cabin crew as well. 10/10.",1
" Travelled from Accra to Bucharest, through Istanbul. Plane was late and I lost my connection. From Accra, they gave me a boarding pass for a diffrent connecting flight than I had booked. In Istanbul 3 different employees of Turkish tried to convince me that that was the correct one and no change could be done, despite the fact earlier flights were available. Customer service was unwelcoming, poor and inefficient. Istanbul airport is small, dirty and congested. They sell lower cost tickets, just because you have to wait for up to 10 hours in the airport. Be prepared to be misstreated. It seems that rudness is a part of Turkish Airline culture.",0
" Bad experience I was flying from Istanbul to Prague by TK1769 on Aug 28. The plane has been A321 and I have never seen such a worn out plane. Personal entertainment system was not functioning. The biggest problem was that my seat did not fix in upright position, which was making both me and the passenger behind very uncomfortable. I felt like plane must be 20 years+ old just to find out it is ex Jet Airways (India) plane, only 8.5 years old. The plane was really poor and crew visibly uninterested to try resetting entertainment system or finding a suitable seat for me. They did not care. Very disappointing.",0
"  Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha. Three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive; headset had a loose connection resulting in sporadic audio connection. Seat 18 J was broken so my family was split up. The USB connection did not work so I could not easily charge my phone. The seatbelt sign was on for over 3 hours of leg one so the coffee didn't materialize until I requested it. Both sectors seem to consist of 2 services of 2 hours each and from 3 to 5 hours into both flights the crew were in the galley, no additional drinks. Not the usual standard Qatar. Connecting at Hamad easy.",1
" I've been flying Cathay Pacific London to Hong Kong and back for nearly ten years now. Here's why. I started off flying Virgin because I'd already accumulated air miles with them and the price was right. However I soon found out that their airline staff are overworked and tired, food was mediocre and, worst of all, I still couldn't acquire enough points to get into the Business Lounge despite frequent flying. A quick calculation showed that if I joined Marco Polo club I'd go Silver after a few flights and I would get to book extra legroom seats free of charge with the advantage of extra luggage allowance plus being able to check in and queue for the flight using Business Class. No brainer then! Over nearly a decade Cathay have kept up their good service on-board. It seems like the airline staff can't do enough for you, including serving snacks and noodles and drinks throughout the flight. Meals are good (and much better when they upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business which happens when the flight is full), the entertainment system is excellent and the extra legroom seat option is a bonus. Having said that, relatively recent changes to the seating has resulted in less padded seats with a recline method that is uncomfortable, making it difficult to sleep, so deduct a star for that. Overall I'll continue to fly Cathay simply because the staff make a 12hr journey so much more pleasant than many other airlines.",1
"  
Check in at AUH fast, Al Dhabi contract Lounge average in terms of offerings and service. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha uneventful with good service and decent snack. Oryx One Play entertainment system again not working throughout the flight. No contact gate in Doha with a long 20 min bus ride from a remote stand. Qatar Platinum Lounge South crowded, but fast service and good offerings. 2nd leg to BKK aircraft change from A380 to B773 without being informed. Random seat assigned. Luckily realized this some time before and changed to a decent seat. Boarding organized and from a contact gate. Flight service good, with average catering. WIFI not working.",1
"  Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Won't recommend unless you have no choice.",0
"  Tokyo Haneda to London. Flight was okay in business class on Boeing 777, not my chosen airline but paid for by client. I have used ANA on previous London/Tokyo trips and ANA are superior to Japan Airlines, they seem more international and staff are much nicer. Check in and lounge in Tokyo was efficient (lounge rather crowded), seat onboard Boeing 777 was comfortable, but cabin temperature was unbearably hot and stuffy (to suit Japanese passengers). Food was passable (again, well below ANA), inflight entertainment is poor. Clean cabin, poor washrooms (no amenities at all). I can see what ANA is 5-Star compared to Japan Airlines.",0
"  Flew Copenhagen to Mauritius via Dubai, EK151 and EK701. Nice experience. Especially first leg CPH-Dubai. Clean new aircraft. Good service and food. Surprisingly good legroom and comfort, the best I've experienced in economy class. Even the lavatory was clean and spacious. Lots of entertainment on big screens. Flights arrived on time or ahead of schedule. We really enjoyed our flights and will definitely use Emirates again when possible.",1
"  Dusseldorf to Hong Kong. Having had high expectations, my first business class flight with Cathay was somewhat disappointing in terms of service. The new business class seats are great, providing great privacy and space. However, the inflight service could be improved. Dinner service started late and took a long time. Also, being in the last row of business (there are two rows in a separate cabin just in front of premium economy) meant that the food was almost cold by the time it got to us. Service attention was patchy - tea for breakfast was served long after the tray was put down. Maybe it was that we were in the ""forgotten"" area, but it really was not a service experience that I would expect from all the things I had heard about Cathay. Also, the fact that premium economy passengers get to use the business class lavatories means a great deal of disturbance being seated on the alley. And lastly, having almost 5 minutes of advertising before the inflight entertainment starts, is a bit much, in my view. Watching TV series meant having to fast-forward every time. And, lastly, the question whether business class passengers should pay for Wifi access or not - or should at least have one hour for free. All in all, little things that could be improved on easily, but they do make the difference between good and great service.",1
" 3 of my 4 flights with Turkish airlines were delayed in this trip and my luggage never appered altough they told me it was onboard. Now they are still looking for my luggage with all my personal things. And it is because I contacted them, thet never did. I almost missed my 2 connections but I run the whole airport,  very bad situation. I cannot recognise this company any more.",0
" The first time that I am writing a review on airline services, but I had to write a review for ANA. I was Head of Mission (13 pax) of the Belgian Blind Devil (blind football players) flying from Brussels to Tokyo. ANA offered us excellent support and assistance on the ground level and also on board the aircraft. The service was excellent, extremely kind, polite, respectful and very helpful, with an appreciated anticipating attitude. We flew Economy, the seat space was ok but not exceptional. The food served was good. I can definitely recommend travelling with ANA All Nippon Airlines.",1
  Sydney to New Delhi via Singapore. The food (IVML) served on my flight from Sydney to Singapore was horrible.  I complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. The food on Singapore to Delhi flight was also below average. I previously always had an above average experience with SIA but looks like they are cutting costs. I pay a premium to fly with SIA and expect services of acceptable standards. Will not fly with them in future.,0
"  Horrible experience. I misconnected at CDG and consequently had to stay in Paris for two days. Air France has not offered me any sort of assistance, no meal vouchers, no courtesy call, no hotel accommodation, no transfer voucher or any compensation whatsoever. When I arrived at my final destination (more than two days later) I found out that my suitcase was also lost by the airline. No compensation for that either, no apologies from the airline. Just saying nothing is their fault. Why did I misconnect? After arriving on stand, the Captain told us that there was no ground staff available to operate the jetbridge. So we had to wait. Only one dispatcher for so many flights - the Captain’s words. We were seated on the aircraft for about 45 minutes. Naturally a lot of people started to panic and complain while still on board, heavy arguments started between crew and passengers regarding who should be re-seated, with swear words flying around. After disembarkation a long run started. Be aware, if you are planning to connect at CDG. Most of the airport is closed/unused. Transfer signs are covered with A4 sheets with handwritten “closed” notes and arrows on them. Staff are blocking routes and re-directing passengers. Only two immigration officers at transfer area, processing several hundred passengers. Only a few security lines open at transfer area, for a huge crowd of people. Buses between terminals run every half an hour and I am not exaggerating. Air France knows you can’t connect in such a short time, because it’s simply impossible. They will still sell you a ticket. Because they don’t care if you misconnect. Please only try to connect at CDG if you have at least 3 hrs to connect! And the worst of all, after misconnecting, together with approximately 40 other passengers, we went back to the ticket desk to seek assistance. We were immediately told there was no compensation, no assistance and no rebooking. Without even checking our tickets. Several passengers were immediately reduced to tears. I have never in my life encountered such rude, unhelpful and arrogant personnel. If you are unfortunate enough and must travel at these uncertain times due to an emergency, please please avoid Air France and CDG airport, or if you can’t, make sure you have at least an extra EUR 500 in your pocket to cover hotel expenses for yourself. And please check what alternatives you have in case you misconnect. Also, having a through ticket, purchased directly from Air France doesn’t really help either if you misconnect, they will tell you it’s not their fault you misconnected, so they are not obligated to look after you. I hope this review is useful to someone out there.",0
" Tired planes, food not great - gluten free food was disgusting. Travelled with my wife from Auckland to London return, so 4 business class flights in total for each of us. The Boeing 777 planes were old, tired and uncomfortable, however on the last leg we had an A350 which was much better. Inflight entertainment was poor, the amount of recent films was quite limited. Staff were friendly and efficient. Food for me was not bad, however on one leg the prawns were still frozen. For my wife who is gluten free the food was very limited and quite disgusting. Gluten free gets no choice of food even in business class. One meal was boiled fish, which was overcooked and had no seasoning, often starters were just plain salads and dessert was just ice cream. The worst one was a breakfast which was baked beans, tomatoe and spinach. It seems like gluten free is considered an afterthought on this airline. Even the staff agreed that it was not very good, and that they get many many complaints from gluten free passengers. They asked us to complain as they said the airline did not listen to feedback from staff, only from customers. As such apart from this review we will also make an official complaint. The crazy thing is that this airline is Hong Kong based. Having visited Hong Kong many times we know that Hong Kong has some of the best gluten free food options in the world. Maybe the chef that designs Cathay's menu needs to visit there and try the current gluten free menu on the flight!",0
"  New York to Mumbai via Paris CDG. A very good flight from Paris to Mumbai. Cheap price, lands well ahead of time and the in-flight movie collection is great. Even the air conditioning is very good. Delta operated the first flight and they did a very good job too. The only issue is landing in Paris but the airport itself is very good.",1
"  Osaka to Los Angeles. JAL has high quality service, and on the Boeing 777 has only 8 seats per row rather than 9 in economy class, providing additional width space. Legroom was spacious on this flight. All in all a great flight, save the delay (bit less than 1h) and the choice of movies.",1
"  Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. When booking tickets I was asked if we'd like to pre book the seats a the cost was £20 per seat per flight, as it was a leg flight both ways this cost us £80 each. Outbound was great however before returning I was asked to contact Emirates which I did. I was told flight times and aircraft had been changed, and asked if we'd like to pre book seats - cost would be £40 each. I explained we had already done this and was put on hold, then told we couldn't have our pre booked, paid-for seats and given different seats. I complained at check in and was told I should have read the small print as I'd done it over the phone there was no mention that Emirates could change them if they wanted and that we were only actually paying to have either a window or aisle seats. We will definitely be flying with alternative airlines in future.",0
"  Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. These were our first Emirates flights. Excellent cabin crew, friendly, attentive and happy to engage with the passengers. Both aircraft were very comfortable, but we prefer the extra smoothness and comfort of the A380. For a couple we recommend the central pair of seats which are positioned together with the mini bar section between the seats and the aisle. The wine selection was excellent and food very tasty and of a high standard. Regular supplies of hot towel throughout the two seven hour flights. The only negative was that I struggled to get the wifi set up, but that is probably down to my ineptitude. I could have requested help there but I didn't as I was into a film at that point. The Emirates lounge at Manchester was very good and is soon to be updated we were told. We were very impressed with the food in all the lounges we used, the KUL lounge was excellent too. There very good quality wines, coffee etc on offer in each lounge. Prior to these Emirates flights our most recent business class flights were from LHR terminal 5 and BA, Emirates offering is many levels higher than our experience there. ",1
"  Ground staff are very unfriendly and not helpful, making my trip unpleasant to start up with. The waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order. Nonetheless, I was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems. Seating comfort on the economy class in B777 and food quality are above average. The entertainment screen works fine. No delays on departure. I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.",0
"  The best airline I've flown. The windows shades are automatic dark, automatic colors. The aircraft is big with many lavatories. Wifi is working for Krisflyer members and its free. The IFE is also working with great choices of movies and tv shows and a usb port provided. The breakfast was also great.",1
"  Belgrade to Seattle via Paris. When I arrived to Seattle, my luggage was not there. I asked the Air France staff where it was, and the guy looked at the list of all passengers and searched for my name. At the part where are the details about luggage was written only ""??"". However, they told me that it is in Paris and it will arrive on my address tomorrow morning. They are obligated to give a kit containing toiletries to passengers whose baggage did not arrive on time. But they did not give it to me because they don't have it there. Three days after, the luggage is still not here.",0
"  Manila to Manchester via Doha. On the 17th  August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful. We landed in Doha, and we missed our 0155 am the QR27 flight to Manchester, they gave us another flight to catch at 0810 am with no fee at all and the expectations were the same as the previous flight.",1
" Flew PER-SIN-CDG and then return MUN-SIN-PER. Flight over was good, check in was quick and boarding fairly organized and FAs were attentive from PER. Flew A380 from SIN to CDG and the plane looked tired and there was a film of dust on pretty much every surface - would expect more from a high end carrier like this. Meal service was quite slow, and FAs didn't bother to ask me if I wanted a drink, just breezed past me. Meal collection was also slow - 1 hour to collect trays. Most of the FAs seemed unconcerned with their passengers. Food was OK. Exit Row seats were good, and worth the extra $. MUN-SIN: different story, plane, a 777 appeared cleaner and newer, and FAs were attentive. Sitting not even halfway through the plane, couldn't get my first meal choice on either Dinner or Breakfast. Exit row seats not worth it - cart kept banging into my partner's leg/tv screen as the config of the aisle makes there be a little ""turn"". Window seat on this exit row also has a restricted leg room due to protruding of the exit door. Singapore should rethink this config and do 2-3-2 for the bulkhead to make a bit more space. SIN-PER, FAs attentive, but still meal service was quite slow. IFE on way over seemed good, on the 777 on the way back, new KrisWorld system kept freezing for everyone in my row. Touch screen wouldn't work, then remote, then touch screen. Selection of movies quite broad but TV series lacked a bit of punch. All in all, not a bad trip but if I could fly cheaper on another reputable airline for these destinations, I'd try them out.",1
" SGN-DOH-KGL on A330 and B787-8. Flights on time. Service on board fine, food is deteriorating (small portions, oily, no meat options), but FAs and drink offers almost make up for it. Qatar as a country suffers tremendously from the Arab ban/embargo put on them from their neighbours causing increased food prices and for QR it implies huge deroutings on most African and S-American destinations (add up to 3 hours per leg!). FAs are the best in the air, always focused, energetic, proactive, attentive, and committed, and hardworking. Rarely – if ever? Have I seen better FAs. Personalised service for everybody onboard the business class cabin. They still do charity collections onboard – to my view a violation of passengers. IFE very good. Bus-gating in Doha annoying and tedious.",1
"  I thought I had excellent service from both the ground staff and the staff on the plane, they really did go out of their way to help me. The only downsides were I thought the mediocre food. having to wear a mask the entire time on an 18 hour flight and the fact my tickets say changes are complimentary but they want to charge me the full price of a ticket to change them.",1
"  Queued for Business class check in - only 2 servers. Entertainment very limited, games needs your own device. My meal was very poor. Seats and staff ok. Photo is the 5pm refreshment.",0
"  The crew on Emirates are superb, staff that look like they  love their jobs. It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir, or wearing ""Happy New Year"" head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus  the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it. Other problem was the food. Really appalling! Was happy to go hungry instead.",1
"  Ho Chi Minh City to Seattle via Tokyo. After we were encouraged to book through their online website by Vietnam staff to save money, we were told by their staff in Vietnam that our infant might be over the weight limit for their child bassinet at the time of flying.  We were told that we should buy another seat for infant to be safe. After checking further their website, I found that the weight restriction for infants in the bassinet is 10 kg. I asked them to refund the tickets, to which they told me I must pay a cancellation fee. I suggested they could refund the ticket with no fee as I booked the ticket only 30 minutes ago. They refused because I booked my ticket on the website I was automatically directed to. I decided to deal with this and hope all would be ok. Finally flight day arrived, and we had no baby bassinet and our seats had been moved from our reserved seats. The agent at the check-in counted was very accommodating and did their best to block a seat for us so that my baby could lay down which was appreciated. Onboard I found the bathrooms ill equipped, my food was average, my seat seemed small, entertainment weak, and supplies seemed lacking for food and childcare. The return flights were worse, not receiving our originally reserved seats, and the staff could not make time to help with our seating arrangement which meant an unhappy babys.  I wrote a review after my first flight, and I haven't received any feedback. ",0
" On this trip, my outbound flight from Manchester was delayed by a passenger becoming ill. Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one. The media on the video system did not correspond with the series being advertised i.e., the new series of White Lotus that I was looking forward to watching, whilst being labelled as the latest one set in Sicily, in fact, was the original series which is  a few years old.

"  I booked a premium economy ticket with Japan Airlines from Paris to Sydney. My flight leaving Paris with Finnair was delayed. There was only an hour between connecting flights so I missed my connecting flight from Helsinki to Tokyo. Upon arriving in Helsinki I was met by someone from Finnair who said they were putting me on a Finnair flight. I asked them what what class I was being put in as my ticket was premium economy and I knew Finnair didn't offer premium economy. They told me it was economy and that there was nothing they could do. I queried this with several people before I boarded the plane which didn't seem to go down well with anybody. I was told I was holding the plane up, to get on the plane and to contact customer service when I landed. I did get on the plane and endured 9 hours of a cramped seat. I contacted Japan Airlines when I got back to complain about this and to ask for a refund for this part of my flight. Japan Airlines have told me it is not their problem and I have to contact Finnair. I asked several questions in my letter - who decided I was being put on a Finnair flight, was Japan Airlines given the option of waiting for my flight, why wasn't I asked if I wanted to fly the next day on a Japan Airlines flight. None of these questions have been answered. I am slightly confused why I would be writing to an airline that I have not paid for a ticket to ask for a refund - ie Finnair. My tickets were booked through Japan Airlines so surely it is their responsibility to deal with issues/complaints from their tickets holders. I have written to Japan Airlines three times and got the same response each time, with one response finishing with ""I do hope you will fly Japan Airlines again"". My flight from Sydney to Paris which was actually with Japan Airlines went without a fault. They have a fantastic premium economy product. Plenty of space and legroom. Even though the food served is the same as in economy it was some of the best airline food I have tasted and the service was fantastic too. I actually thought I had found a really good value for money alternative to business class. I am aware things can go wrong and sometimes missing connecting flights is out of anyone's control. However the way my complaint has been handled left me astounded. There has been zero care factor or empathy.",0
"  Gatwick to Istanbul. Very poor service from Turkish Airlines. At the last minute, as we were about to board the plane, we were told that due to a booking error (theirs, not ours) we had to pay extra or be denied boarding.  Would not recommend this airline.",0
"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. ",0
" We flew the 1250 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow. Push back on time but queuing on the taxiway for take off for another 25 mins before take off. The economy cabin was probably 60% full so we had 3 seats between the two of us. A few lucky travellers had 3 seats each so could get some reasonably comfortable sleep. The plane was clean. The set back TVs in excellent condition. The cabin temperature was just right too. Cabin crew very attentive and regularly came through the cabin with juices or water. The two meals were tasty as were the mid flight snacks of meat rolls, crisps and chocolate. As ecomony goes this has got to be one of the best offerings for long haul. However I would say that when the seat in front is reclined it is very intrusive into your personal space and makes watching your own TV screen uncomfortable. The only answers then for you too to recline your seat. If only everyone would just keep their seats upright! The outbound trip 3 weeks earlier was equally as comfortable. 5 stars all round!",1
"  Excellent service, customer centred, professionalism exhibited by the cabin crew, great wine and food selection. Clean and we'll maintained carrier, smooth and comfortable cruise, all working super wifi.",1
" Following up to my previous review """"worst customer service"" 1 reviews J Deene (United Kingdom) 13th December 2023"" I'd thought I would update you on the progress of my complaint Thomas of Emirates Customer Services has been very unhelpful. Of having allergy/food issues heading to Tokyo Narita, I had the same going back plus 12 hours with a broken seat, no ICE Entertainment system and cabin crew unable to move me to another seat, however moved 3 others with no problems. (NRT-DXB EK318 25TH November 2023). I also got cellulitis on the the outbound journey the week earlier due to the issues onboard which DID affect my holiday a dream holiday I saved all year, the flight cost 90% of the money I paid, in the numerous email Thomas of Emirates Customer Service was unwilling to admit responsibility onboard was let down. Those food issue allergies that I told the airline in many months before the actual holiday. The Japanese holiday I am hoping to do every year, 2024 or 2025 won't be with Emirates they have shown lack of care, remember , ONLY caring for one thing the money you have in your bank account. For someone who won't be travelling with Emirates, Thomas of customer services decided 10000 skywards points is ""reasonable"".",0
" I find it appalling that SA’s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didn’t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the child’s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that it’s not professional behavior on the part of SA’s FAs and they shouldn’t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed.",0
"  Vienna to Denpasar via Doha on 11 October, wheelchair assistance requested to an from the airplane doors. In Vienna it worked perfectly, so in Denpasar. In Doha the service was a shame. We were trapped for about 45 minutes in the elevator which should us brought down. It had about 33 degrees and no AC. Then we had wait on the ground for another 10 minutes for transportation. Let me express my disgust about this issue.",0
 I got a last minute upgrade offer and went for it without contemplation. The business class seats on the Boeing 777 were comfortable and I managed to get a very good sleep. The service was excellent and I felt really spoiled and taken care of. The meals were also good starting with the beef and rice dinner and ending with a delicious omelette breakfast. I remember the Emirates infotainment “ICE” had more variety before but I was still kept well occupied.,1
"  I'm very satisfied with the experience flying with them on 25th of April 2021 Dublin to Doha. I flew with this airline probably 10 times, one of the best services cabin in the world.! Must mention here a cabin crew Mr Sundeep was very friendly and helpful, and all the cabin crew doing good jobs thanks you. Definitely I'll fly again with you.",1
"  Singapore to Bangkok. Staff were friendly but not attentive.  Food was poor quality, very simple meal with no salad or appetiser.  No second round drinks were offered during and after meal service. Only plastic utensils were used in economy class. Food tray were not collected until the end of flight. However aircraft is new and IFE was good.  Cathay is doing cost down in the difficult time but I think it has affected the customer experiences.",1
"  I found these two flights quite difficult from a personal standard. The first leg was at 8am, and I was wide awake for and couldn’t rest. The second flight I tried to get some rest but I couldn’t. The food on these flights was really tasty. Especially the Edinburgh to Doha leg. The in flight entertainment was vast and very good. I had checked in online and went straight to security with my E boarding pass, but it didn’t work at security. They let me through then the airline printed me a hard copy at the gate.",1
"  Amsterdam to New York via Istanbul. Have always been satisfied with Turkish Airlines: good service, good food, good prices. However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world). I gave only 3 for seat comfort but it must be said that it is always painful for me to travel on airline seats.",1
"  I had a return flight Brussels-Dakar via Istanbul. I got my flight Brussels-Istanbul on 15 July. However, due to the political situation in Turkey, my flight Istanbul-Dakar on 16 July was cancelled and I was stuck at Ataturk Airport. After queuing for 7h30, I was informed there would be no flight to Dakar for the next three days and was sent to another desk. After another 1h I was informed there was a flight to Dakar the day after, but the boarding flights were printed with mistakes. On 17 July, Turkish Airlines put me on a flight back to Brussels. Therefore, I have never used my partial tickets Istanbul-Dakar and Dakar-Istanbul and they have committed on their website to refund these tickets. However, they are now making it a nightmare to claim back. Throughout the situation, no communication was provided to travellers, staff assistance was poor (the first food provided arrived after more than 10h), and even now the support provided is just not acceptable. There was never an apologies or concerned expressed. You do not want to be stuck in Turkey in the middle of a military coup and have to depend on them.",0
" Houston to Istanbul. Very poor staff interaction, in both the aircraft and Istanbul airport, it’s quite unenjoyable to be in such hostile environment. If you want to have proper communication with the staff, you better learn Turkish. I does appear that Turkish Airlines employees are not getting paid enough to treat people with respect. I believe they used to be the best airlines in Europe, now I am confident to say they are the worst in Europe.",0
  The boarding went on very smooth. The seat was very comfortable and had enough legroom. I was really disappointed with the meals. I chose the lemon chicken with fried rice. It was a very small portion. No salad was offered. The bread roll was in plastic packet cold and dry. The chocolate cake for dessert was okay. Usually flights between the east coast of Australia and Asia they offer a main meal and a pre arrival meal but on this trip no pre arrival meal was given. I feel like SQ is trying to save money by doing this. The IFE was good. Overall I won't be flying with them in the future. ,0
"  Washington to Istanbul return on Turkish Airlines. The crew was very efficient and helpful, and the bottle of water they give out in economy is a nice touch. The inflight entertainment system is excellent and easy to use. Wifi is offered but for a price in economy which I choose not to avail of. On the return flight the captain paid a visit to the economy section and talked and joked with a number of the passengers. I wish Turkish Airlines would bring back the Turkish food they used to serve in Economy (the menu was the same when I last flew with them in December 2017), and they would stop showing the silly safety videos. First with the magician and now with legos!",1
"  The worst airline on the planet: Only get your ticket and don't ask for anything because you won't get it. We paid for extra legroom seats almost $500 extra and we did not get them. We paid to select our seats and they gave us different seats. We asked for the bassinet and we did not get it. We called to ask for the weight of the suitcases and they told us 30 kilo per bag when we get there they say it's actually 23 kilos. They don't care that they gave us the wrong information, They fined us for each bag. They said sorry we don't have extra leg room seats left. Are you kidding me? You already know how many extra legroom seats you have and to how many people did you sell those? Turkish Airlines is a thief and wants your money. They have the most horrible customer service and you will never see your money back. Don't waste your time asking for a refund. ",0
"  New York JFK to Hong Kong return. Although generally good service per reputation, several items were quite disappointing.  Cathay Pacific Airways does not subscribe to TSA Pre Check so security lines at JFK are particularly long. Second, they do not have wifi, which for a 15 hour flight is very isolating. Also, the return in premium economy was not markedly better than outbound in economy, except for bigger seat. Premium economy cabin service was spotty, trays left out long after meal with no follow up coffee or drink refills during or after dinner service. Food cart rammed my aisle knee very hard twice with little apology. As others have noted only 1 toilet for all of premium economy  which lead to long lines/wait times. They did not recognize One World affiliate FFs on same level. I am lifetime Gold in Advantage, but got nothing in terms of boarding, seat preference, upgrade consideration, etc. Check in was good but not above average. Overall, disappointing when compared to touted Asian carriers and almost as poor as AA, UAL or DL long haul.",0
"  EK202 was delayed from JFK to pax annoyance, as a result missed connecting flight which I chose to have 1:20 hrs layover but now I'm waiting for almost 6 hrs at DXB. Other reasons, I was assigned different seat at JFK while I had pre-booked another one. Food wasn't impressive, Qatar Airways had better food a few weeks earlier on the same route, Crew was great. Full disclosure, at DXB a staff members waited near plane exit to direct passengers, handing new Boarding Pass and food vouchers. I'm still waiting for the next flight, and haven't checked airport voucher food yet (hope it won't restrict me to a Big Mac or some).",1
"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home).",0
"  It was my first time flying Turkish Airline and it was a very pleasant journey. The flight I took was from London Heathrow to Taipei via Istanbul. I chose this airline simply because it provided the best route/price for the date that I had to fly. The staff were all diligent, kind and helpful. As well, I was surprised to have received the amenity kit sitting on an economy seat. They also gave out a warm hand towel and menu before serving meals which I find very considerate.",1
  The May 19 flight was announced as a cancelled flight while waiting at the gate when all passengers have already checked in. The cancelled flight was rescheduled the next day but was delayed for 3.5 hours.,1
"  I had a little problem at the check-in counter in Barcelona that was solved thanks to the attention and the comprehension of the ground crew. The pilots were great, nor only we took off on time but we also landed a bit in advance. The meals were worthy of 4* restaurant and the selected wine was perfect (as a French citizen, it makes the difference). The cabin crew assigned to my seat were great in dealing with my vagal uneasiness, they gave me a 5* service while I was feeling so unwell. I am looking forward to flying with them again soon. ",1
"  Johannesburg to New York JFK via Dubai. There was a total of 7 of us travelling on 2 separate bookings (6 people on 1 booking, 1 on another). Our flights home beginning on August 3, 2016 had us travelling with British Airways, Emirates and JetBlue Airways. We had no issues with our flights on British Airways and Jet Blue. Our luck ran out upon dealing with Emirates for our return flight home. I called Emirates August 2, 2016 (24 hours prior to our flight) to request kids meals and a vegan meal for 3 of our passengers. While on the phone with the representative, I inquired on our current seating arrangements to ensure the children would be sitting with the adults in our party. When I provided the booking number for my husband, I was advised his ticket was cancelled. You can imagine my shock upon hearing this. I asked the representative why it was cancelled, who cancelled it and when. I was advised it was cancelled July 24 – 1 day after we started travelling – and 6 months after booking the flight. The representative advised Emirates cancelled the ticket as they saw 2 tickets for a Brett Hale. My son’s name is BH Jr and my husband is BH. There is no space to enter a suffix within the Travelocity website. However, it is noted that one ticket was a child’s ticket and one was for an adult. In addition, I had to input the date of birth for each traveler.I never once received a phone call or email from Emirates to confirm I did in fact book a duplicate ticket. And I did not receive a refund for the cost of a ticket that they cancelled. After the representative informed me that Emirates made the error in cancelling my husband’s booking, I requested his ticket to be reinstated as it was, so we would all be travelling together. I was told that the second leg was full and that wasn’t an option. While informing the representative that that was not acceptable and that Emirates needed to find a way to ensure my husband was travelling with us, I was told he would send an email on an “Urgent Basis” and someone would be in touch with me. At this point, it is 7pm and the first leg of our flight home (via British Airways) is at 8am. I had been on the phone with him for over an hour. We were in a game reserve in the middle of South Africa and my cell phone did not have service. He advised I could try calling back in an hour. Long story short, it took over 4 hours and multiple phone calls to multiple people to get his ticket reinstated. Even then, I was not confident he would be flying home with us. I was extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service and how they handle their own errors.",0
"  London Heathrow to Dubai. The service we received today was appalling. This is the second time we have flown with this airline and the service has been consistently poor. First of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. The hostess snapped at me when I asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for. Another staff snapped and told us we should wait when we requested for juice to eat our meal which was served an hour after everyone had eaten, as our preferred choice had .",0
"  I booked premium economy because I have knee problems. The seats are just OK (shell type that slides down but not built for a person over 6 feet), and the food is the same as economy, although it was the best fish I ever had on a plane. Overall, a very decent product, and the flight was on time. They lost my luggage, so I did not have winter clothing as it was summer in South Africa. I bought what I needed for €240 and Air France reimbursed me within 10 days. Overall, very satisfied and impressed by the no fuzz reimbursement.",1
"  Sydney to Singapore. Biggest standout which are most important to me. Service -staff have excellent communication are very proactive, thoughtful and attentive to your needs. The flight was very smooth with the pilot's communication being very clear. Food: excellent without being flamboyant.",1
  The infight Filipino crew were the best. They were able to provide excellent service to all passengers. Requests made by passenger were given full attention and services provided were genuine.,1
" I booked this airline because of the paid wifi option. It worked on the first leg of my trip (Manila to Dubai) but it didnt work at all on the 2nd leg (Dubai to Washington Dulles - 14 hours). This route to the US is longer than the Pacific route but I booked it precisely because it offered paid internet. Unluckily, the internet did not work on the longest leg. I filed a complaint to Emirates and they said that it is really not their problem and I should file a complaint to their internet service provider.",0
"  I should state the inflight crews are nice and the aircraft are nice, however, when things go wrong, this airline is the worst I have ever experienced and does not care if customers face issues. I recently undertook a Business QSuite Trip from from London to Angola for the cost of circa £5000 and the biggest problem was as a result of an initial 6 hour delay due to problems with the aircraft, we missed the second Qatar Airways flight. As a result Qatar gave us no options but rerouted us down to Johannesburg and then up to Angola. This resulted in a 17 hour journey becoming 32hr, but the biggest problem was the Qatar booked some of this via an alternate airline organised by Qatar Airways, which I can only describe as ancient and worrying. This was meant to be a QSuite flight and was chosen so I could work en-route, arrive refreshed and get to work straight away. I wrote to Qatar Airways on my return and they paid out the initial compulsory delayed compensation and then gave a very generic ""Sorry, we take your feedback seriously"". I have made no progress getting any sort of resolution, all you can get is the generic response). The entire AV system didn't work on one flight - I couldn't charge my laptop on one flight.  Overall, the very worst customer service ever experienced.",0
"  Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated.  As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",0
" Bangkok to New York via Dubai. Very unfortunate experience on my latest Emirates flight. I'm a Skywards member that flew in late February 2017 and had a poor experience. Later I made a complaint via email including the details. They took more than 5 weeks to reply and then just told me it never happened. From what I understand, this is par for the course with their customer service. I'm horrified by the customer service for this top-rated airline. I won't be flying them again.",0
"  Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didn’t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets.",0
"  Flew Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore. I found the flight very enjoyable and on par with previous flights with Singapore Airlines. Check in on both the going and return trip was smooth and pleasant. The theme was reflected across the rest of the flight meaning at no point was I left feeling stressed or perturbed. I especially enjoyed the return flight from SIN to DXB since they had used a newly refurbished 777-300ER which had all the new bells and whistles, incl. touch screen IFE and refreshed seats. While I did not use the in-flight Wi-fi, it was good to know it was available and operating.",1
"  Lima to Paris. Very poor. Online check in wasn't possible from Lima. Enquiries to customer services were dealt with in an unsatisfactory way. The seats on the plane were uncomfortable. Cabin crew didn't seem to take their job very seriously. The safety talk at the beginning did not seem to be done properly (didn't seem to be enough staff to do both sides of the plane). Food was okay. Luggage was transitted no problem. In flight entertainment was dated and didnt work, old fashioned screens in economy.",0
"  Booked flight on Emirates website but first part of journey was from regional Australia with Qantas flight. Luggage checked all way through to Dubai so did not have to transfer it at Brisbane. Checked in on line and when arrived in Brisbane the customer service was very good allowing us to change seats to back of plane as was not a full flight so had 3 seats for 2 passengers, a very comfortable flight and the cabin crew bringing around drinks between meal service. Arrived Safely in Dubai on time.",1
"  Singapore to Johannesburg. Daylight flight on A350 in premium economy. Checking-in and boarding was quick and efficient, with a warm welcome on-board, as is the norm with Singapore Airlines. There is generous locker space in premium economy, sufficient to allow blankets, pillows etc not immediately required to be stowed. Drinks and nuts were served shortly after take off, with champagne offered, but unfortunately served in a tiny plastic faux champagne glass. We had ordered lunch from book the cook. The quality was good, but would be so much better if served on proper plates and not in foil dishes. It is unfortunate that Singapore provide only economy service in premium economy. Drinks were offered with the meal, but again served in small plastic tumblers. Wine was simply red or white, and of mediocre quality. No refills were offered, and when trays were collected some time later a requested refill never materialised. With a good choice of entertainment and a comfortable seat the 11 hour flight seemed to pass quite quickly. The crew came round on a number of occasions with water and fruit, and a second hot meal was provided 2 hours before landing. Overall it was a very pleasant flight. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, and the A350 is a very nice aircraft. However it is unfortunate that the enhanced level of service expected in premium economy is not provided.",1
"  We flew an itinerary Melbourne to Dubai return via Singapore in August 2023. We joined their Krisflyer membership. Having done that, we opted in for their ""Auto Check In"" for each flight. Singapore Airlines automatically check you in and email your printable boarding passes 24 hours before each flight departure. You do not have to check yourself in online. Our flights and seating for MEL-Singapore, Singapore-Dubai, Dubai_Singapore we were auto checked in and I printed the boarding passes at the hotel each time. But, while staying in Singapore for 2 days prior to our flight, 24 hours before our SIN-MEL flight, I kept checking my emails for the auto check in. By 1pm, 12 hours before our midnight SQ237 flight I received no auto check in. I knew something was wrong. I called their Singapore call centre and quoted my SQ RES Number, and said I have not received our boarding passes. For no reason, they hung up. I re-dialed the number, another operator, same thing, they hung up. On the third attempt the first thing I said to the operator ""Do not hang up"" I gave my REF booking number and we had pre-allocated seats 41D and 41E. The operator said ""I cannot find this REF number"". I patiently said, "" Go to SQ237 seats 41D&41E  you will see our names on those seats."" Nothing. I started to get distressed but kept my cool. I said ""If we go to the Airport they can sort it out"". No. you are not on that flight. So, I said, "" what do we do?"" He told us we have to re-book the same flight for the next day and pay an extra re-booking fee of $430. At that moment I thought, we just have to get on a flight, book it and work out the problem later. I looked up the seating on my ipad as he was doing the re-booking and requested the vacant seats, 70B&70C. He told me they are not available and put us in a three row on 46DEF. We went to the hotel lobby and booked an extra night at$353. We got to the airport 9 hours before our flight at 3pm, and showed them our paper itinerary at check in and said we did not receive an auto check in email or boarding passes and that 70B&70C are in fact available, and yes they were. Do your own check in online. I am in the process of filing both a complaint and claim to Singapore Airlines.",0
"  My partner is a student, and we’re in the process of moving her home, we called to add her student Kris-Flyer account to her ticket and they confirmed over the phone they did, and that they left a note and that they unfortunately couldn’t send email confirmation - despite our requests. The ground crew were asking for email confirmation and attempted to charge us 600+ euros for the extra weight (€60/kg) despite our allowance supposedly covering this. Then the ground crew advised us to pay now and attempt to claim later (which in a previous experience which costed me €2000 didn’t get me any return) We turned up 4 hours before our flight. It’s been 2 while being on hold again for another hour to get re-confirmation. If you value you your time more than this avoid them if you can, pre-covid, Singapore was best in class. Now they’ve begun to nose-dive.",0
"  From arriving at the airport on our journey and throughout the cabin staff were run off there feet, and are a credit to the firm. Very pleasant and accommodating, nothing was too much trouble. Having read the baggage policies many times, and cutting our baggage to a minimum, I was appalled at how many people were over the limit on size, number and weight of the cabin luggage. The cabin staff are having to struggle on moving bags around to get everybody accommodated, they should not be lifting these overweight bulky items to a level higher than they are. Then having to pacify a complaining passenger whose bag was more than the accepted size because they had to move it further down the cabin. I would like to say a big thank you to all the cabin staff that delivered great care and devotion to all in my section D/E 31, They worked wonders.",1
"  I booked a flight on Singapore Airlines on the 18 March 2016. I checked in at Manila NAIA Terminal 3 and the check in staff provided excellent Customer service. I was very pleased with the service provided by the cabin crew as they paid a lot of attention to the passengers needs. IFE needs to be updated to cater to the needs of passengers. I was unfortunate to experience the first generation IFE Tv monitor on my flight. I feel that the airline needs to upgrade their IFE to ensure passengers are well taken care of. I will definitely fly again with them!

" San Francisco to Jakarta via Incheon. To be clear, the prestige class cabins in Korean are not cutting edge, they aren't the best in the skies. Infact, the seat width are quite narrow, and could be noticed when trying to stretch out. Though, while they lack on the hard product, they throw all this over with their soft product. The cabin crew were very disciplined and very friendly. They did speak perfect English and did go around the cabin a lot to make sure if anyone needs a drink or would like some freshly baked cookies that they have just made (they were excellent). They had excellent food and a lot of it. They were all cooked to perfection, both the Korean and Western meals. Although I would recommend the Korean dishes because they are after all, a Korean Airline. IFE is acceptable with new movies and a good airshow that worked, so no complaints there. Overall, Korean Air has reasonable fares from Asia to North America and is worth the price. Even though the seat is not cutting edge, you will be able to sleep (especially because of food coma). I do not have enough words to express just how perfect the cabin crew were, and they made the whole experience worthy.",1
"  Istanbul to Geneva. This airline is a mess. On the ground I asked to change my seat even if I needed to upgrade - “we are full”, so I asked again “ok so your answer is no?”, “yes I just told you we are full”. I got on the plane and business class is empty.I asked the flight manager “sorry I cannot upgrade you on the plane”!  First they have no idea of the situation or seating arrangement or he didn’t listen to my request, or they are not interested in being successful and profitable.",0
"  First flight from Dubai to Doha was extremely hot until about 20 minutes after take-off (it was around 45 degrees in Dubai). The A320 was small and did not appear to have been cleaned since the previous flight. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was first delayed by 2 hours, then by another 4 hours, with no explanation for the first 2 hours. Flight was delayed a total of 6 hours due to a technical difficulty with the plane, however there was a serious lack of communication. Inflight entertainment was outdated. Flights on the way back were marginally better and at least they were on time. ",0
  Istanbul to Barcelona. We missed our flight in Istanbul.  We asked for help we even pleaded for help and was ignored by everyone behind counter.  We called the customer service and received no help because of lack of English. Finally about 2 hours after our flight had left we were able to talk with someone at the counter and told we had to buy a full priced ticket for $700 per passenger.  We called our son back in the states and he was able to get us on the same flight that they were trying to sell us for $700 for only $270 from an online travel site. ,0
"  If you live outside of the EU, Air France will not compensate you for a severely delayed or cancelled flight. On September 22, just a few hours before boarding an Air France flight from Vancouver to Paris, I was informed by email that Air France had cancelled my second flight from Paris to Nairobi where I was supposed to begin a safari. My only option was to take a Kenya Air flight from Paris to Nairobi, 12 hours after I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site). But Air France refuses to compensate me, using the loophole of an obscure 2004 regulation that states that if the flight does not originate or end within the EU, they're off the hook. First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU? Air France has an obligation to treat all customers equally, and not give preferential treatment to customers who fly only within the EU. When I flew from Dublin to Vancouver last year, and the flight was delayed by 10 hours, Air Canada paid me compensation. ",0
"  Warsaw to Hanoi via Dubai. There was a significance difference in the quality of service between the 2 flights. The mainly Polish crew on the Warsaw to Dubai leg were quite abrupt and rude. The chief purser seemed very stressed and the crew did not seem professional at all. The TV screens were also quite old and not very responsive. The Dubai to Hanoi leg was much better. We had more comfortable seats towards the rear of the plane and the crew were excellent. Especially, the Brazilian flight attendant who saw we were trying to take a selfie and kindly offered to take the photo herself. Her colleague even went and pulled down all the window blinds in the last few rows to make the photo clearer. I was seriously impressed with this level of attentiveness. So overall, Emirates is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the quality of the staff. Some are amazing, others mediocre at best - and some downright rude.",1
" Cape Town to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates has to be the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They state on your ticket that you are allowed 30kg of checked in baggage. However, when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. Now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport, they let you ""get out"" of the dilemma by paying $75 (USA). Most passengers I met on board stated they had to pay this amount. When myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff, we were all rudely told ""you need to read the fine print and that it a new Emirates policy"". I was also shouted at by the senior manager in Cape Town because I asked him to explain why this policy was in place. After we argued for almost 30 mins, he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. They also ran out of food and I had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. Staff on board also don't seem to like their job as they don't respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. As a frequent traveller to all parts of the world, this is the worst airline I have ever flown. Emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff. I will never travel with them ever again.",0
"  Turkish Airlines has disappointed us twice. Especially the customer service was very disappointing and made us very upset. We travelled from Düsseldorf via Istanbul to Riyadh and back in Sept 2023. Both ways we had delays. The way there we could not make it to the connecting flight, so we were offered a later flight and a voucher for some food at IST airport. The food court was disappointing, as all the ‘restaurants’ that are on the voucher offer had non vegetarian food. The way back we had a delay as well. We arrived at gate A1. In the airplane they could not give us any information about the connecting flight (whether it would wait for us or not, or about from which gate the connecting flight was leaving). We ran for 25 minutes (and really a sprint) and we made it. Our luggage did not. When we arrived at Düsseldorf airport we made a report with the employee from the lost and found department. She told us the luggage would be sent to our home address. It never happened. 3 days after that we received an email that our luggage arrived in Dusseldorf. But since then we never heard from them again. So frustrating. Customer service of Turkish Airlines said it was not their responsibility anymore, it was the handling office at the airport. The only thing the Airline did was sending emails to this office (we did that as well), but without any result. They never got back to us and did nothing to help us. We sent dozens of emails and called everyday, but without success. In the end we travelled 2 hours back and forth to get our luggage. Besides that, it was not possible to make an official complaint. The customer service on the phone told me to fill in a feedback form, but the reaction on this form said they could not handle this feedback. I cannot believe how bad the service of Turkish Airlines is. Never ever have I’ve experienced something like this.",0
"  Shanghai to Dubai. Fantastic crew. Emirates has never let me down with their service, be it on the ground or in the air. Very punctual chauffeur pick-up from the hotel to the airport, smooth boarding and one of the best crews ever on this flight. Super attentive and ever so helpful, I could have stayed onboard for much longer!",1
"  Sydney to Delhi via Singapore. Amazing airline. Excellent customer service. Good food. But cannot understand how this, one of the best airline in the world, has ignored the plight of thousands of travellers who order special meal for so long. The problem is neither with the food nor the service standard of the crew. It is to do with the processes of serving the special meals. Special meals are first served. But no drinks are offered or served on demand. Either one should wait until the remaining passengers are served food with drinks and get a drink and let the nice food sit on the tray and let it get cold. Or eat the food without any drinks, not even water. Singapore Airline should change its processes so thst the crew should bring the same trolley containing the selection of drinks while serving the special meal and offer the same selection of drinks to passengers being served special meal.",1
"  Belgrade to Doha. Belgrade's airport is small and you cannot get lost. Checking in was fast, but my passport needed several scans. First boarder control then security separate at each gate. Business lounge a kind of basic, but ok. First time on a Qatar Airways narrow body aircraft. 12 seats in a 2-2 configuration, seat the same as on the airline's A330-300. Very comfortable and fully flat, really big touch screens. Only the room for the feet on the 2C/D and 3C/D a little restricted for taller men. Amenity kit without cosmetics, but sufficient for a 4 hours 40 minutes flight time. Food and drink menu superbe as always. Not much difference in comfort in comparison to a wide body aircraft.",1
" Paris to Vancouver. Enjoyed flying with Air France. Boarding was on time, organised and ground hostess were smiling and friendly. The aircraft was clean with a beautiful cabin. Economy seat are quite comfortable and the inflight entertainment is pretty good. An hour after take off lunch was served, food was good and more bread was offered during the service. Another lighter meal was served before landing in Vancouver. There was also a bar setup at the back of the aircraft with some snacks where passengers could help themselves in case they were hungry during this long flight. I travel very often and I have to say Air France is doing very well compared to other European airlines. Totally recommend flying Air France.",1
"  Dubai to Gothenburg via Paris. First time flying with Air France since 2004. The service was as good as I remembered. The food and drinks were very good. After take off a nice snack with a chicken salad, bread, croissant, and a dessert with a nice hot breakfast before landing. The crew were very nice and service minded. On the second flight with HOP also great service and a nice snack included.",1
"  Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Check in fast and swift, and a good Lounge in Melbourne. A333 from MEL to SIN departed on time, and had plenty of room to spread around as flight was relatively empty. IFE good. Did not eat on this flight and cannot comment on food. Singapore lounge in Terminal 2 so so, and looks more like a canteen. SIN to DEL red eye operated by a Boeing 777-200 which was refitted. Packed flight and crew not as good. Food and IFE average.  Not bad flights but won't say they were very good either.",1
" I travelled from Istanbul to Kayseri on Turkish Airlines flight TK 7296 on 22nd June 2019. The flight was delayed for 2 hours and upon reaching Kayseri, our baggage didn't come. We waited for 30 minutes, only to meet the person who informed that our baggage was left in Istanbul as the flight was overweight. We weren't provided with any proper reports for the same and the personnel just wrote our details on a paper while promising us to deliver us baggage to our hotel in Cappadocia, the next morning (a pathetic manner to handle such situation where no official report is made). Next morning, I called, emailed concerned authorities hundreds of times and never received an appropriate response. The only thing I got to hear was to call someone else or I should speak in the Turkish language because the people there do not understand English (which is horrible for someone who works at an airport). In fact, one of the personnel lied saying my baggage has left for Cappadocia. After all the frustration, I drove 1 hour to Kayseri airport to collect my baggage. Nobody was there to check if we are collecting the right baggage (anybody can take anyone's else bags). No proper report was given. The next afternoon (after more than 48 hours), someone called us asking whether we took our baggage or not. This is not only horrible, pathetic service from Turkish Airlines, but it is downright fraud and cheating where you people lie to keep the passengers quiet and show no responsibility towards the safety of our luggage. Terrible customer service with no ethics or morals. Being tourists, we carry everything in one bag and that being delayed, puts us in great trouble whereas Turkish airlines are least bothered about the same. Nor they bother to inform or compensate.",0
  Flew with EVA 4 times in June both economy and Elite class. Always professional and kind service with quite good inflight food! Boeing 777 has a great leg rest for Premium Economy and I wish they had kept it for their new planes. Only disappointment is no PTV's on the brand new A321 to Cambodia and no wifi. ,1
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha on Qatar Airways, and both legs were on time, seats comfy, staff very friendly. Could have checked more often during the night if drinks were needed. My choice of gluten-free meals had been respected on our outbound flight, on the return flight they forgot about it. The movie choice was interesting. But on the leg Doha to Frankfurt I could neither finish the film that I had started on the first leg nor enjoy any other of them. Shortly after the start, my entertainment system broke down completely out of the blue. As some rows in front of me, a passenger seemed to have a medical problem, the steward was not able to look after such a minor problem as mine. So I was not even able to enjoy all the reworked blurred-skin-sequences that made my husband laugh, as I sat on the other side of the aisle and could not watch his screen either. By chance, I had a good book, and after an hour or so, I fell asleep. As I had another problem with my entertainment computer on the outflight, too, I think Qatar should check their IFE more regularly.",1
  London to Rabat via Paris. This was my second time. First time I travelled last year and flight was one hour delayed.  This time the flight was 3 hours delayed and then the connecting flight left us and they put us in terrible hotel and next day the flight got two hours delayed because technical issues and returning flight was 2 hours delayed. I will never recommend Air France. ,0
"  The flight out to Thailand was great. However the return flight was cancelled due to Covid. Qatar Airways was offering a change of date in place of return flight or refund or voucher. I recently contacted Customer services to arrange my return flight this has been very difficult and I've been told that they issued me with a voucher without me requesting this option. I have tried to have this rectified to enable me to book the return flight home to replace the original cancelled flight. The customer services have not been helpful in regard to this option, they now want to charge me a further amount for return flight offering the voucher value as discount on the ticket I require. After further discussions as to why a voucher was issued they inform me that another party had requested this without my consent or knowledge. Despite this they tell me that they are unwilling to put the error right and issue me with a return ticket.

  Beirut to Doha. Attentive and professional I’ve flown with them on business and first class and the service is incredible. Very professional and friendly special the chief stewardess she walking around and introduce herself to us and willing to assist us with anything. The food was amazing during my flight. Overall my journey with Qatar airways was amazing.,1
"  Brisbane to Auckland return with Emirates in business class. From check-in, the flight crew, food and drink selection,  seat comfort and inflight entertainment selection, the experience was 10 out of 10! I was seated in the upper deck of the A380 both ways, which can be an advantage. I look forward to a longer flight (Europe), with Emirates in the future. Keep up the good work!",1
"  New York to Manila via Tokyo. The aircraft is really clean, but the seat is horrible, instead of your back going down, your butt is moving forward, the temperature is warm and very uncomfortable. I asked the flight attendant for an ice, she gave me a soda in a room temperature and told me that they don't have ice.",0
"  I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldn’t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I don’t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the plane’s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty.",0
" Atlanta to Istanbul, A350 plane seems new, nice and clean. Food was good cabin crew was friendly. Istanbul to Bangkok, 330 plane seems aged and old food and crew was good. Overall experience with flight was great. Ground crew not so much.",1
" Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years. Thank you Qatar see you again in September when I test drive your new Lisbon route.",1
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Kigali to Miami via Istanbul. Excellent in-flight service from very helpful flight attendants of both genders. Very accomodating in helping to stash away multiple musical instruments. Inflight meals and entertainment top-notch, a fantastic selection of Turkish music and bollywood/world films. Cabin temperature good, not freezing cold. Blanket and a nice pouch with slippers, lip balm, dental kit, socks, eyepatch and earplugs, plus moisturizer in the toilet all help on longhaul flights, especially on multi-stop journeys of ~24 hrs. The stopover in Istanbul goes by quickly with all the shopping (bazaars and bookstores), and if one has in transit for 6 hrs, Turkish Airlines has free Istanbul city tours that leave 3 times a day.

"  Be aware if your flight is delayed. QR1111 Bahrain to Doha was delayed by at least 2 hrs which meant I would miss QR904 to Melbourne. I was fortunate to notice this on flight information screen of the lounge I was in, and; the staff there got me on a Gulf Air flight to Doha so making my connection. Had I not seen the notice board I'd have missed my connecting flight. Qatar Airways on the ground were found wanting. Doha to Melbourne flight was a good experience all around once in the air with good IFE, good food and attentive staff. This airline has to keep customers updated at all times especially on delays, offering quick alternatives to help passengers. They maybe 5 star in the air but are nowhere near this on the ground.",1
"  My last experience with Air France was very good. Had a very long flight from Papeete to Paris via Lax for transfer. The cabin crew were very caring and even funny! The inflight entertainment offered a wide choice of movies and music, with some recent releases. The food quality was exquisite, two times services from PPT to LAX and again from LAX to CDG. The seat was very comfortable and I slept like a baby! I would book for sure again Business Class on that route, if only prices wouldn't be that high for this way! It was worth it!",1
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Perth to London return via Doha in December 2016. Boeing 777 on all legs apart from London to Doha which was an A380. No real complaints about the planes or cabin crew. Entertainment good, good leg room (although I'm only 1.7m). Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious. Overall, a good value pleasant experience but meal and drink service needs improvement.",1
  Very appalling service. inflight toilets were dirty and without toilet tissues. I did inform the crew to clean and put toilet tissues but they ignored my request. Three members of the crew kept chatting in their little room. Quite few people asked water or other drinks but it seems the crew kept taking ages to serve the passengers. My flight was scheduled to depart 10:00 AM in the morning. When I reached the airport I was told by the check in staff that the flight has been delayed until 15:00. I received no email. No notice by either text or phone. The Turkish airlines manager just asked my if I want to change my flight and that there is nothing he could have done about this problem. Since I am missing my connection at Istanbul I asked him if they would provide accommodation and transfer. He promised that he would do that and inform his colleagues at Istanbul. That has proven a lie. At Istanbul airport the staff were very rude and unprofessional. They categorically refused to provide accommodation and I had to linger in the airport for over 8 hours. Customer service is very poor. staff is incompetent and indolent. See the photo of the meal (attached) given as a compensation for the delay. Stay away from this airline.,0
"  Minsk to Beirut via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines lost my baggage along with the baggage of other customers, this is unacceptable. I submitted my claim at the airport, I hope they will return it in good condition so i could update this review.",0
" Flown a total of 4 legs (Hamburg to Beijing via Dubai) with 36 persons together booked individually. Check In process was rather complicated because of pre-assigned seats but managed to pack the group together. Luggage drop off in Hamburg was very unfriendly and machine like by AHS staff with shouting throughout the terminal. But Emirates representative was very friendly and helpful with checking in 36 baggage pieces. Flight experience was superb. Several services were offered on all flights and asking for beverages in the galley was possible at all times. Paper menus were offered. Friendly and multi lingual cabin crew on all legs. Very caring for 5 ill kids throughout leg PEK-DXB. Greetings and good bye with not only professional smile. We were afraid of B777 10 abreast configuration - a bit tight but not cramped at all with 6'1"" height. Living space in A380 was superb. Partly bad reviews could not be verified using Emirates on those 4 legs.

"  Due to winter storm in Chicago, they cancelled flight from Kochi to Dubai and Dubai to Chicago. The winter storm issue was with the second flight. But they cancelled first flight because they don't want us to stay in Dubai because it will cost them accommodations and food. They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates. Will never forget the incident and crew was worst.",0
"  Beirut to Dubai. The whole trip was fine related to staff, service, welcoming. However we have moved to the bus and we waited like 20-25 mins just because 1 passenger lost something. All the passengers in the bus waited until this passenger came in. This was unacceptable as this can be managed differently. And all the crew have left before us.",0
"  Auckland to Zurich via Singapore return and we flew with our 19 month old boy and it’s was his first flight. We were quite picky of choosing right airline and it’s a very long journey for little boy, I like to say Singapore Airlines is the best, very friendly staff and child friendly, alway willing to go extra miles to help their passengers. It’s a five star experience, we will fly with you anytime, and recommend to everyone",1

"  Taipei to Seoul. The stewardesses were  polite, and helpful. I was surprised by the comparative good quality of meals they provided for a less than 3 hour flight from Taipei to Seoul -- with metal cutlery. The aircraft was new and comfy with many entertainment choices. You don't need to beg for pillows or blankets - these were automatically provided to you.  Their ground staff in Seoul do need to improve their English skills if they want to attract more international travelers.",1
"  Frankfurt to Sydney via Seoul. We were very pleased with Korean Air. We flew from Sydney to Europe return via Seoul. On the way over to London Korean Air put us up at the Grand Hyatt in Seoul overnight. I recommend you ask your travel agent to ask for this option as it was fantastic. On our return trip we used the new transit lounge in Terminal 2 of Incheon airport which had showers, free internet and a 'sleep zone'. The airline experience itself was good. We experienced little turbulence on all flights. The food was good though they could improve their dinners (although the Korean bibimbap option was good - we all had it twice!) Breakfasts were better than good. The cabin crew were great and helpful when we requested additional snacks, water etc, although they served enough water to keep us hydrated. The hot towels before breakfast were also appreciated. My 13 year old son said the inflight entertainment could be improved although we thought it fine. Australians do not often fly Korean Air to Europe but I would recommend you consider it as an option. ",1

"  Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats.",1
  Nakhchivan to Istanbul. The flight set off a little bit late and boarding was disorderly with too many passengers carrying oversized baggage on board. The aircraft appeared to be old with drop-down screens for entertainment which were virtually useless. Cabin service was not very good and staff appeared not to care.,1
"  Singapore to Los Angeles. I know we paid a little extra for this one-way flight, but it was totally worth it! The most comfortable, newest, economy seats we've even seen.

" Bangkok to Hong Kong. On this fight, Cathay Pacific let me know it is a 5-star airline, even though I am in economy class. Boarding was fast thanks to the ground service in Thailand.

Also the food is delicious and they served nice red wine in economy class.",1

"  I flew a total of 4 Turkish Airlines flights on my recent trip to Europe, from New York to Paris CDG via Istanbul, returning from Frankfurt to New York via Istanbul. The cabin crew were warm and friendly,  food was quite good for aircraft food, especially if you are a fan of Turkish food. Expect a small salad, a yogurt/tsatziki sauce, choice between a chicken dish and a beef dish, with the lighter meal consisting of a pasta dish. There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back. For longer flights, they provide a little pouch of amenities like an eye mask, ear plugs, slippers, lip balm, and a toothbrush/toothpaste. For the price I've paid, I found the flights to be a genuinely pleasant experience and I would definitely fly with them again.",1
"  Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha. Impressive service from beginning to end. The new lounge at BKK is a huge improvement on the previously shared lounge with THAI. Every encounter with Qatar staff was professional and based on the highest level of training. The business class lounge at Doha is now busier than when it first opened, as a result of which there is always a queue for a shower, but thankfully, it only takes about 15-20 minutes to wait until one is freed up.",1
"  Vancouver to Clark via Hong Kong. I bought a round trip ticket from a reliable ticketing Agent. But I phoned Cathay Pacific directly and confirm many times to make sure that our flights is no changes and no any inconvenience situation. From Vancouver to Hong Kong flights is ok. But arriving to Hong Kong My husband and me was very disappointed by changing our boarding passes Hong Kong to Manila. I asked why but they cannot give me the specific answer. They just assured me that someone will assist us when we arrived in Manila. So I asked one or two or three staff how they will transport us to Clark Int’l Airport and they said by bus. My husband and me were shocked thinking that they will transport us by air not by land because thats what our air tickets is and didn’t bought land transportation. What a ridiculous experience, we even waited for so long for the bus provided plus for our relatives who picked us up in the Airport at Mabalacat was so worried to us expecting that we are arriving early in the morning but it turned out in a very late afternoon. I don’t think I will be recommending this airline to my family, friends and colleagues.",0
"  
For the first time, my wife and I flew with EVA Air from Toronto to Manila via Taipei. Checking in at YVR, there was a long queue but I was relieved to find that there was a separate lane for Premium Economy passengers thus check in didn't take that long. The flight was fully booked, however, the staff who checked us in was able to arrange for my wife and I to be seated next to each other. The flight departed on time, and about and hour and a half later dinner was served. Having flown Premium Economy previously with fellow Star Alliance member carriers Air Canada and Turkish Airlines, I was expecting more from EVA or at least something similar to what AC and TK have. That EVA serves meals to its Premium Economy passengers using plastic utensils was a letdown to begin with. While the meals maybe considered satisfactory, drinks were served in child-sized plastic cups including the wine which for some may be somewhat unappealing. Overall the impression I got was that there was no real difference between Premium Economy and Economy except for the extra leg and shoulder space. Choice of movies wasn't that up to date.

"  Brisbane to Paris via Hong Kong booked for June 2020. Air France Sydney office used to be very helpful, not any more, and they don't answer their phone. So I had to book online, business class to Paris and back to Brisbane. All booked and paid for. Then I discovered that Air France had substituted an economy flight to Brisbane without my knowledge. I specified business on the web site, but only afterwards did I find that an economy leg had been substituted. ",0
" The First Class lounge in Doha is amazing and then we went on a VIP bus to the plane which actually took longer than the flight. The front cabin on the plane which they called First it wouldn’t qualify for even a C class in Europe.  The take off and landing were immaculate, the pilot was amazing and food was ok. That is all I can say about a 55 minute flight.",1
"  From boarding in Dusseldorf to reaching Changi, everything went smooth. We were greeted by professional well-presented crew.  Upon reach my seat in Premium Economy I wanted to take photo of my seat, where a cabin crew delightfully approached if she can take a picture for me while sitting and said ""it is great to have you on-board Sir and I would like to assure that your special meal is loaded"". We left DUS in time. The service followed with hot towel, drinks and nuts and meals. Using book the cook service means getting your meal before your fellow passengers. The meal was okay and we were offered three choices of warm bread and big selection of fancy drinks. After meals, they served ice cream but missed on me, where a crew assured that they are not offering it to me since I am vegetarian and ice cream contains gelatine. Since it was a day flight, crew was actively anticipating needs and were very busy serving to a group of very demanding passengers in economy. This flight had dedicated crew for Premium Economy and they came around at least 3 times to assure if everything is fine. Many rounds of snacks in a basket and drinks on tray and crew looked enthusiastic, service minded and very friendly. We were made to feel like welcomed guests. I walked to see economy class, the crew were happy to chat about A350 product.  The aircraft by itself is very quiet, quieter than B787 and toilets are spaciously planned and were kept clean. The air ventilation can be really felt and cabin design made me feel relaxed. The Captain announced turbulence, and crew walked through the cabin to ensure we have fastened seatbelts. Before landing, breakfast was served and immigration cards handed out. We landed in time and I left the aircraft as a happy passenger with a feeling that this was my best flight ever.",1
  Washington to Istanbul. Food service was poor. They run out of dinner with fish after serving almost 50 passengers and I had no other option but pasta with cheese sauce.  My return on Sept 19 2017 was terrible. A woman was changing her baby's diaper by the food service area. Flight attendant was incapable of doing something about it. During dinner time they once again run out and I was served this time eggplant with rice.  By the time they service our section my food was cold. I gave my dinner back. When I told the flight attendant she said 'she will let her supervisor know' but nobody came to talk to me nor offered anything else to eat.  I believe I had to get upset like other passengers to receive better dinner and service.  I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for 15 years and have lost confidence for the quality service and competency of keeping passengers satisfaction. ,0
" Do not fly with Emirates and FlyDubai. Extremely poor management from Emirates and Dubai Airport. Did not have permission to leave Baghdad and had to wait for 4 hours and arrived late to connection flight to Sydney. Once arrived to Dubai, provided new flight in 9 hours with no accommodation and no other services. This is an example of extreme mismanagement of Dubai Airport and Emirates. And when you ask their staff for help, they literary try to ignore you.",0
"  The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World. ",0
"  Los Angeles to Lahore via Istanbul. Very poor service and uncaring crew and staff. Hope to never have to fly with them again. The ground staff to the plane crew, felt like they hated their jobs and were miserable. Unapologetic and uncaring to the max! The lady at the IST airport at the check in con yet couldn’t find my reservation even after providing my PNR code and 5 mins later when she did, she made us feel like it was our fault for some reason. Horrible customer service. The planes on both routes were super old! They need upgraded planes after spending so much money building that  new airport. The old planes don’t do justice. Spend a little more if you can, and fly with an airline that actually cares about their passengers.",0
"  Beijing to HK on Cathay Dragon, no hot food, only cold water, little if no service. I fully understood and appreciated considering the breakout of Coronavirus. Hong Kong to London, 1 out of 3 toilets in Economy is marked as ""out of order"". This turns out to be Crew Only toilet, making long queue all through the flight, as 2 toilets covering nearly 200 passengers. The service is extremely poor, I asked Gin and Tonic 3 times, always been told they will come back, never. The passenger next to me does not understand English but only Mandarin; when crew distributed foods, she pretended only spoke English. After 10 secs of silence, the passenger said ""Ji"" (Chicken in Mandarin), the crew immediately pass the chicken dish to him with a rolling eye.My son (2 years old) experienced running nose the night before and the morning (flight is in afternoon). I called them saying although he is not fever, I do not want him to fly to risk the whole passengers. While other airlines offers free change or cancellation in China, I have been told there is nothing they can do. The last part of the service has seen after I made a complaint to the service, Cathay response back to say their toilet is only out of order for 1 hour then open (a completely lie as it is crew only for the whole 13 hours).",0
" I was looking forward very much to the experience on Singapore Airlines, and even more so, the A380. I was in the bulkhead seat in Premium Economy, so the very first row on the lower level. It was a nice smooth flight, The IFE was adequate, But I was a little disappointed with the level of service. I've always heard about how attentive ""The Singapore Girl"" (ie.flight attendants on SQ) were The service was far from the worst I have ever had on an airline, but not as good as I anticipated. Maybe I was comparing it to the absolute best service I have ever had on an airline I flew on my last overseas flight, a Taipei-based airline. Don't get me wrong, It was not bad at all - just not as good I was expecting.",1
"  London to Dubai return. Appalling customer service with Emirates. I was taken seriously ill and collapsed at Terminal 3 Heathrow. Emirates made trying to get a refund nearly impossible. No customer care and branded me a no show when I was in front of check in and attended by Terminal 3 manager who spoke to the check in clerk. Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional £200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you £213. How is that for customer services. I would have expected more from Emirates and whilst the luggage allowance is greater British Airways offers a better customer experience. ",0
"  Melbourne to London return via Singapore, with A-350 on both MEL-SIN legs, A-80 on SIN-LHR and B-777-300ER on LHR-SIN. Early departure  from MEL and very efficient service. The A350 business class seat and fit-out is very modern and high quality. The A380 and B777 is a bit older but still good. Lie down bed takes a bit of getting used to for set-up and pack away, but once you've got the hang of it, it's great. Helps you to sleep much more than when sitting. Meals were very nice and enjoyed book the cook options. The flight attendants felt the need to wake me for meals, even when I had put the Do Not Disturb button on. Perhaps they could say at the start of the flight when meals are expected, or allow you to choose a time within a certain range? The IFE was excellent with a good choice of recent and older movies. I found the headsets pushed into my ears, which got a bit sore after a couple of hours. I wear glasses, so that might be the reason. Amenities were available in the bathroom, although I didn't realise this until the second leg. Perhaps they should announce it or tell you upon boarding, rather than leaving you to wait for a kit? Overall, very pleasant flights despite the length. On MEL-SIN-LHR, the flight arrived at Terminal 3 and departed Terminal 1, which was a bit disappointing for the national carrier's airport. I had gone to the lounge before realising my connecting flight was in a different terminal.",1
"  Singapore to Houston via Manchester. Flight left Singapore on time and cabin crew provided hot towel followed by drink and light supper after take off.  FAs patrol the cabin with water, juice and snack runs every 15-30 minutes and very helpful when I requested additional drinks. They turned the lights back on and started the hot towel, drinks and Breakfast service before we arrived in Manchester. Flight deck communication was adequate; we know we were ahead of schedule and can expect that Manchester is foggy and cold when we arrived. Entertainment system was a slightly older one without touch screen but still contains more than enough movies, TV series and games to keep passengers entertained. The flight left Manchester behind schedule but arrived on time in Houston. Fresh set of crew got on board from Manchester going to Houston. There is one FA that we knew from our previous flight 2 weeks back between SIN-CGK; back then she mentioned she'll be in this flight and she was! She was one of the better crew members in our past flight and her bright and cheerful personality shines through in this flight as well. Even though other FAs in this flight to Houston were also polite, courteous and helpful as expected, but most of them were not as personable and does not exude a warm personality in giving their service. Most of the FA on this flight tends to give mechanical service and you can feel that they are here to perform as expected, but missing the part where they should be able to engage their customers in a more personal way. However they did a great job in providing their services throughout the flight, keeping us full with three meal services and drink-snacks in between, also keeping the restrooms clean and well-stocked. Flight deck communications are adequate; we were informed about possible turbulences along the way so we can prepare, the time we will be arriving in Houston and also the local weather informations.",1
"  I wish to express our heartfelt appreciations to the excellent caring and professional service of Qatar Airways. On our recent flight on QR 853 on Wednesday 23 March from Kuala Lumpur to Doha enroute to Washington DC My wife was feeling quite unwell coupled with the late night departure. She tripped as she entered the aircraft. The stewardess caught hold of her and prevent her from falling and kindly walked her to her seat. Throughout the flight the cabin crew check on her! On arrival at Doha for our next flight via QR 707 to Dulles, a wheelchair was waiting for my wife at the ramp & she was wheeled to an electrical Vehicle that took us to the boarding Gate for our connecting flight The attention and care by the cabin crew and the ground staff was beyond what any passenger would expect. May I offer my deepest gratitude and appreciations to Qatar Airways and the staff that assisted us during the flight, Qatar Air have our votes for being the most efficient airline. ",1
"  Very nice flights with Qatar Airways. Aircraft clean and well maintained, professional cabin crew, they never disappoint. The only thing to complain is that I passed through Hamad International several times and they never used fingers but only buses. This implies long wait and traffic jam due to the high number of buses. I imagine this is due to the strong increase of Qatar Airways destinations, but in any case it's a pity for such a beautiful airline! All in all, very good work Qatar.",1
"  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",0
" Turkish Airlines makes a real effort to give even their economy passengers a positive experience. Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience. My flight back to Turkey and the USA next week will be in business class, so I am looking forward to the award-winning premium service.",1
"  London to Hanoi via Istanbul. Hard product on both legs was faulty, no IFE on 14 hour second sector between IST and HAN; no apology or alternative. Toilets filthy, had to wait 10 mins to use a WC with stewards unwilling to police the use from other cabins. Planes was way too hot, uncomfortable to sleep. Food overrated and ridiculous that meal service takes 1.5 hours from beginning to end on a 02.35 departure. Food quality was poor. Cabin crew lack finesse and understanding, had to ask for water as no approaches. Couldn't connect to wifi on OS or Windows. Loung in Istanbul impersonal and too big. Left onboard in sweltering cabin for 2 hours during stop in SGN enroute with no offer of refreshments. Dreading return flight and will not use TK again.",0
  This airline is getting worse. Since COVID hit their prices skyrocketed and the service got worse. Flights delayed and caused nightmare for connection passengers. Most of staff can't speak proper English. The airline charges extra for wifi service which never works.,0
"  The cabin crew were amazing, the food portions were very small for someone 6'2"" but okay. The in flight entertainment was rubbish. Arrival at Haneda, had to walk miles to get to the lounge.

Lounge closed at 11pm and 12 business class passengers had to sleep in the airport.",0
"  My husband and I traveled on business class from Zurich to Karachi on Saturday July 1, and Turkish managed to leave one of our bags in Zurich. I have wasted a huge amount of time trying to get the airline to get my bag back to me. First their help desk said it was on the next flight, i.e. Sunday afternoon. Then they said it would be sent on the Sunday evening flight. Now they say it will be delivered tomorrow. As of now, their helpline says the bag is in its way to me, but the tracker shows my bag sitting in Zurich airport. There seems to be no way to get through to a person in authority and the airline seems to have no interest in helping.",0
  Everything started great with them. The booking process was surprisingly easy especially with COVID-19. I booked the ticket for my girlfriend to come and visit me here in the US and she said the flights to Seattle with them were great and she had no complaints. About a week before she was going to depart Seattle to go home she got sick and had a positive COVID test and I had to suspend the ticket. The process of suspending it was very easy because I just had to send them the PCR test showing a positive result. But now sense she has recovered we have been trying to get the ticket reissued and have been trying for 2 weeks now. They have been extremely slow and been lying constantly about returning phone calls and making false promises for the new rebooking. As of now I have sent the positive PCR results in 3 times to them and am starting to go around the same loop again. I will update this as more news come.,0
" Boarding for my Hong Kong to Manila flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to inclement weather. Once on the plane, the pilot explained to passengers that we would only be able to take off 1 hour 15 minutes from the gate closing. However, the pilot was patient, and cabin staff served a good sandwich snack (traditional ""adobo"" Filipino dish) while waiting for pushback. Inflight entertainment options were very good, and I was pleased that the Ed Sheeran album ""Divide"", a personal favorite of mine, was offered. Pushback commenced and the A330 was able to take off. The flight to Manila offered the high standard of service Cathay Pacific is known for. The seat was comfortable and had good legroom, despite it being the middle seat. Highly recommended and would fly again!",1
" Istanbul to Tel Aviv. The inflight entertainment was not activated. When we add the crew they told us there is a problem, but we noticed that during the flight it was on PA mode. One of the passengers near me orders a kosher meal but got another, and discovered that it was not the kosher one. So when she addressed the crew, they were not nice to her (asking her ‘so why did you open it’. She didn’t know). All in all, it was the 4th flight with TA in the past week, and it was the worst one of them",0
"  Flew A321 from Incheon to Kaohsiung. Overall a good flight. I got a gluten-free meal, which, as is mostly the case, was a bit tasteless, but okay. The meal service felt a little more rushed than it need to be. The seat seats were comfortable and spacious enough, although there is no personal entertainment — this is a little disappointing for an otherwise high-quality, full-service airline. The seat-back tables are quite small and slippery, with an ineffective drinks storage spot, also the flight was a bit turbulent, so the crew were only able to hand out tiny amounts of drinks; lest they slide off the tables, I guess. Therefore if you are thirsty you need to keep asking for refills. Plane landed ahead of schedule. Crew were friendly and efficient although there is a lot of room for improvement with English — especially pronunciation.",1
  I regret my last trip Kolkata to Dubai. The staff did not even greet. They carried a really bad attitude & a zero customer service. The food was left over as I dint like it. The quality of food is not good as before & the staff really negative attitude. I really need to think again before I book with Emirates for my next trip.,0
"  London to Melbourne via Doha. I found an excellent fare with Qatar so I had to give them a go. My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you. Easily my new second favourite airline.",1
"  Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. We had 21 kg excess luggage when the ground staff saying  you have 21kg of stuff to dispose of. When my husband asked him again what he was saying then only he’s explaining either we pay or throw our stuff for 21 kgs. This is lack of professionalism to me. Not only that, the supervisor was rude too. Without a smile and arrogantly he said either you pay or you throw then he walked away. We all know this but at least display a professional and appropriate manners towards us. We ended up paying 5kg excess. I bought a return ticket for the first time and this should be my last. Never again to travel with this airline.",0
" Newark to Athens. It was my first round trip on Sep.18.2019 and Oct.11 2019 with Emirates! And also my last! Never again! The seats are so tight that you do not know in the middle where you should leave your arms! Like animals in transport, you sit! You can not eat either! Which is not so bad, the food was a catastrophe! Barbecue Chicken should this be, I do not know what it was! The air conditioning did not work on the way to Athens! It was very hot! My blood pressure went up and I felt very bad! On the small seat, you could not sleep! Very uncomfortable! It was a very old plane! I thought it was a rich airline, now I know better! On the way back from Athens to Newark USA (a 10-hour flight) again an old plane. I feel the metal from the seat! I still have pain today! Next year I will fly again with Lufthansa!",0
"  Best airline to fly for a family with an infant. Safety measures were as we expected, the crew was amazing with us and our baby.

"  Our flights were all delayed and the transfers at Changi Airport were not smooth. Going flight on 14 April 2023 SQ929 SUB-SIN, the departure from Surabaya was delayed. When arrived in Changi Airport, we could not get on our flight to Haneda, and our flights were changed to Narita. The airport change caused longer travel time (from Haneda to home is less than 1 hour but from Narita is more than 2 hours) and cost (from Haneda is about 500 yen but from Narita is about 4500 yen). Return flight on 16 April 2023, SQ631 HND-SIN flight arrival to Changi Airport was delayed. While we could make it to connection flight to Surabaya, our luggage could not. We were disappointed with Singapore Airlines.",0
"  Birmingham to Cape Town via Istanbul and Durban. BHX to IST a comfortable B737-800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew weren't very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasn't very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330-300, much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT, including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities (toothbrush, socks.etc) given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPT-IST via Durban on an A330-300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737-800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall, not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English. ",0
" Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards. And when you upgrade and pay extra hoping that you will get some rest and sleep the seats don’t function as per my case.",0
"  Amsterdam to Tashkent via Istanbul. This was the worst experience ever. I had 2 hours overstop. Flight was one hour delayed and in the end arrived 1.5 hours later. Instead of a good service their service desk treat you like a jerk. Not only they Do not say sorry or show compassion by the fact that i will not make very important meeting, they lie you about the business class seats availability and give you free ticket to eat at burger king, what is the worst food. I never had worse experience with an airline. Please do not fly with this airline as you will save your nerves and health.",0
" Dubai to Moscow. Emirates is the worst airline in the world. Food onboard I have not seen worse. Flight delayed for several hours. Employees of the airline at the counter at Dubai Airport behave rudely, refuse to comply with international flight rules.",0
"  London to Mombasa via Istanbul, after being told and having my ticket verified by a lady agent at the international transit desk just before passport control that i qualify for a free transit hotel for a layover as my transit time was 18hours. I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn’t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel. ",0
"  My sister flew from Houston to Tehran via Dubai. In Houston, she paid $225 for an extra suitcase. The agent asked for cash and said they do not accept credit card but after my sister insisting that she does not have cash, they accepted her credit card.  Upon her arrival to Dubai for her second leg of her flight, she was asked to pay over $300 again. When she showed her receipt and the destination noted, the agent started to scream at her and say, either she pays or she will lose her flight. When she tried to reason, the man started to scream more and louder, and took her passport. My sister told him that she will pay, just tell her how to do it. Then the agent took her to a counter and when she went to pay, the price was increased to $350. She paid with credit card and they wanted the pin to her credit card. She told them the she did not have the PIN as this was not debit.  She decided to pay in cash, so she can leave but the agent got on her face. She was handed a repeat for $285 and she did not get her change back out of $400.  Now, I am scrambling in Houston to find a return flight for her, so she does not have to return to Dubai and moreover, to travel with Emirate. ",0
"  I travelled CPH-DOH-BKK on 1st and 2nd January 2017 - on B788 and B77W, respectively. Check-in counter in CPH puzzled me as QR now start to disallow checking in luggage further than the first tickets end-destination. That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok – this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service – this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire – likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture – why can’t they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent. Second flight DOH-BKK with equipment change due to poor load factor to mobilise the A380 and was changed to an older B777-300ER without 1st class and bar. Pre-departure drinks included champagne. The seats could not go horizontal, only some 165 degrees angle – but were fully flat. Food and drink service excellent and pyjamas and kits were given out. Nice, light breakfast given out close to landing – here I got my beloved smoothie.",1
" Manchester to Mauritius via Dubai with Emirates. Never flown with them before but would definitely do again. Customer service was faultless, the space on the plane was plenty and entertainment fantastic. Eat and drink as much as you want - a fantastic airline with great staff. Terminal 3 at Dubai is just for Emirates and the airport itself is like a small city with so much to do and see.",1
"  The absolute worst customer service i've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. After booking a ticket online which was booked as being changable though not refundable, and booking an extra empty seat, when trying to change my flight date i could no longer do it online because of the extra seat, which i booked ONLINE so no idea why they sell it if they cant then handle the rest of the customer journey. Then when i called customer service, the first person told me the system was down, the next 2 people told me there's nothing they could do and suggested i call the local sales office, while I'm in a country with no local sales office, where my flight origin has no email or telephone number for that sales office, and where the country I'm landing in has no published sales office. So there's absolutely no one for me to call. And then after messaging them on twitter, again absolutely no help, where they told me to call customer service, and then to call the local sales office again. My flight is Monday, all sales offices are closed on the weekend anyway even if i wanted to call, and now I'm forced to buy a new ticket or to exit the airport during my transit and try to deal with what will most likely be a sales office who are just as useless as everyone else has been so far. So far the worst experience i've ever had dealing with an airline, and in all honesty i would never fly with them again if i had a choice.",0
"  Bangkok to Kuwait via Doha. As usual it was an excellent flight. Cabin Crew, Food & Beverage , Cleanness of cabin, toilets all very high standards. Especially the cabin crew was down to earth. I rate their business class one of the best amongst any other airline.",1
"  London to Lahore via Doha. London to Doha A380, 9 am flight on time from Heathrow, an aisle seat with leg room. Flight comfortable and breakfast served. Doha to Lahore Boeing 777 not a new aircraft and fully booked. Again an aisle seat with hard cushion and less leg room. Meal served somewhat uninspiring, but cabin crew efficient as always. Arrived in Lahore on time. Return flight from Karachi to Doha - very early departure (3 am) but check in etc still quick and we left on time-aircraft airbus A350, relatively new and more spacious than the 777. Seats comfortable and enough leg room - I am over 6' tall-leg room is important. Before take off passenger in the seat in front of me was sick, cabin crew quickly provided sick bags and a more senior cabin crew member questioned her about her medication. We took off but the passenger and her son were moved elsewhere in the plane. Crew handled the situation well and other passengers were moved to the seats as the plane was full. Breakfast was served but was very ordinary.",1
"  When booking my flight, I originally had a 4 hour layover, but Turkish Airlines asked if I wanted to extend my layover to 20 hours and participate in the Istanbul Stopover program, where they provide free hotels to travellers with layovers over 12 hours. Over a month before traveling, I sent in the request for the stopover (which only needed to be submitted 72 hours before departure). I was sent a hotel voucher for the wrong date and name, so I emailed back to correct it. The Turkish team did not respond to my 5 emails over the course of a month to correct it. When I got to my layover in Istanbul, I assumed that if I explained this and showed the emails, I could get a hotel or some compensation.  Their reason for not allowing my stopover was that there was another flight from Athens to Istanbul the next day that I could have taken and had a four hour layover. I called customer service who made me submit an urgent ticket that would be resolved within a few hours. My ticket was not resolved and I had to sit in the airport with no apology or compensation.",0
" Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option. Emirates is very much a last option for myself now.",0
  I've been flying Qatar airways all the times and this is the first time I use Emirates. I had a horrible experience. The food is really bad and the service is terrible. The staff are not helpful at all. Many seats are empty but they don't allow anyone to use them. They kept them empty the entire flight which was 16 hours. I will never use Emirates again.,0
" I understand sometimes things can go wrong and not all flights I have with them I am enthusiastic about but the fact is Turkish really seem to have got their act together. Spacious cabin, nice hot meal, selection of drinks and onboard entertainment: no other airline flying this route gives so much service. Turkish truly deserves the name of full service carrier, no doubt!",1
"  The indifference starts at check-in at the monstrous new airport in Istanbul. Manned by miserable and non-talkative staff, just going through the motions. Security seems lax compared to other airports and the queues start getting longer with angry and impatient passengers who appear to jump the queue. Uneventful flight, usual low level of service, can't be bothered attitude from cabin crew giving out bottles of water and snack box. No interaction with passengers, command of English very poor and no-0ne speaks Greek. Very few Greek passengers on flight as most prefer to travel with Aegean Airlines and with good reason. I'm still laughing as to how customers can award Turkish Airlines Best European Airline. Clearly they don't read the 1 and 2 star reviews on here by so many unhappy passengers. I would give them NO stars if I could. They should be rated as a 2 star airline.",0
"  Istanbul to Singapore via Doha. Last minute aircraft change from a 773 to a 333 on 4 hr flight from Istanbul, and not a Qsuite. The change of aircraft is becoming irritating. I have been downgraded from a Qsuite three times over the last couple of month without notification or apology.  The 2nd flight from Doha to Singapore was on the gorgeous A350-1000 with the Qsuite and flawless service. What Qatar lacks is consistency.",0
"  Better flights overall on the return journey then outbound. Annoyed, however, that one of my two pieces of checked luggage did not arrive at IAD with me. Two days later, I still do not have my bag. Upon arrival in IAD, I was informed over the loudspeaker to come to the baggage counter where the form was already filled up for my signature and address for baggage delivery. I expected my bag - priority tagged for a business class ticket - to come 24 hours later on the next daily flight CDG-IAD, But, no, it came on the daily flight two days later. I see no reason why my bag was off loaded in the first place. I had an 8-hour layover in Paris which affords plenty of time for bags to be transferred. Also, I also see no reason why my bag could not have been prioritized for the next available flight to IAD the following day, not two days later. This was my first time flying AF in about 25 years and I can't say I'd be rushing to book with them again. They should prioritize their business class passengers paying several thousands of dollars for their tickets.",1
" I have been a strong supporter and promoter of Qatar Airways up until this past return flight that my wife and I took from Doha to Athens (28th June 2022) and return (27th July 2022). The outbound flight crew were awful and the cabin service was poor, the crew appeared tired and 'hassled' and were not at all friendly. They did not appear to be fully trained as the usual and past cabin crew have always been, the food was really poor and tasteless. We took advantage of an upgrade offer (QR3900) for our return journey to Doha hoping to enjoy a better quality service upon our return. It proved to be anything but. Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages. We boarded on time and the crew were definitely better and friendlier than our outbound flight, the menu appeared OK but when the food was served it was not up to the Airlines usual standard. I had only a mouthful and could not eat the rest, the chicken that was served to my wife was overcooked and extremely tough. So from a clear '10' that we would rate on all of our previous flights with Qatar Airways our rating on this recent experience would be 4/10.",1
  Okinawa to Tokyo. My daughter and I just took a mini vacation to Tokyo  we flew on Japan airlines. After we arrived in Tokyo my daughter was informed that her dog was in the hospital and very sick. She tried with many different employees of Japan Airlines to change our flights to fly back earlier but they refused because she bought the tickets from Expedia. Well these two customers will never fly Japan Airlines again.,0
"  Our flight from PER to DOH was cancelled three hours after the flight was due to depart due to technical issues with the plane. Qatar Airways staff informed travellers that they would be booked on the next available flight. However, no information about re-routing was provided and passengers were told to check for text messages. Our attempts to reach the Qatar Airways call centre in Doha were not successful. Six hours after the scheduled departure time and we still had not received text messages. Qatar Airways moved passengers to their flight 24 hours later. We informed Qatar Airways staff that we did not want to be re-routed. and we booked new flights with Emirates.  Qatar Airways forced passengers to wait 24 hours to avoid re-routing customers with a competitor.  Much of this angst could have been avoided if Qatar Airways had been genuine about minimizing disruption to customers. The new flights cost us $1,500 each, which is $650 more each than the original flights. We sought compensation from Qatar and they declined to offer any compensation. Customer service was completely unhelpful and did not make us a token offer. ",0
"  Dubai to Delhi . The journey started from our hotel to the airport. Emirates provides complimentary chauffeur drive in Dubai. The chauffeur service, priority check-in and the lounge were exceptional. The ground service helped us navigate our way in the airport. Boarding was smooth, the plane was old however, with clean interiors. The inflight service was not up to the mark. The crew wasn't courteous and did not meet the expectations of business class. The big let down was that the crew did not offer or serve any desserts and even refused to provide a second round of drinks.",1
"  When I arrived at my departing airport, Baltimore Washington, my flight was cancelled for my first leg due to bad weather. This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasn't a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights I'd say the first wasn't as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldn't be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didn't get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane. Inflight entertainment was top notch. There were plenty of movies, TV shows and music. The internet was choppy w/ my device so I just stayed w/ the entertainment they provided. I also think the food was great. I enjoyed all meals and they were portioned just right. As for the issue of my refund, I'm still fighting.",0
"  Cairo to Oslo via Paris. I never got to travel.  I ordered a ticket from them online on the 14th March 2020. Everything seemed in order and I received a confirmation that the booking was confirmed. I could also see that the amount had been reserved on my MasterCard. The e-mail with the confirmation did not include a lot of information other than a link to the details of my trip online. By accessing the link I could see that everything was in order. The next day, when my travel was supposed to take place, I checked the link once more, but this time nothing showed up. I just got a blank internet site. By contacting the airline, they informed me that my booking was cancelled by them. I had received no information about this from the airline. The given reason was that it was apparently not possible to order a trip from Egypt with Air France online within the last 72 hours before departure. Nothing on their website had indicated this as far as I could see and my booking had through. The man I spoke to had no solution to this problem, but told me I had to personally show up at the airport and order a flight from Air France and pay in cash. I told him I needed a booking to make sure I got a seat, given the coronavirus situation. He made a new booking in my name and told me I had to pay for the tickets at the airport before 22:00 p.m. I went to the airport very early to make sure I would get my ticket in good time, but at the airport there were no one from Air France. By calling them I got information that my second booking also had been cancelled (again with no warning from the airline) and that they wouldn't have personel on the airport until three hours before the flight, meaning not before 22:50 hours p.m. The guy I spoke to this time said he would make a new booking for me, but he could not guarantee that this new booking would also not be cancelled and he could give no guarantee for availability. This was ""not in their policy"", so he could basically do nothing. I asked him if it was in their policy to accept two bookings from a customer, reserve money on their credit card and then cancel the booking twice without giving any information or heads-up to their customer. A question for which their representative had no answer.  I was not willing to take anymore chances of delaying my booking any further, so I booked another trip with Emirates without any issues at all. Now, four days later, on Tuesday 17th march, the amount is still reserved on my MasterCard. As a finishing touch, I might add that I had three friends who actually made the trip with AirFrance on the very same flight I was supposed to take. The time of their booking online? The very same day as I made mine, meaning, well within 72 hours of departure.",0
  Singapore to Melbourne. The flight didn't start well as the departure was delayed for over an hour an no announcements were made. Once boarded we found the cabin configuration rather cramped. Lie flat beds were satisfactory but fairly hard and narrow. There is no convenient place to store small items while sleeping. Overhead lockers were good. The mainly female flight attendants were distant and in some cases unfriendly. Service was poor. Cabin supervisor was good but he couldn't be everywhere. Overall it was a very disappointing flight.,0
"  Travelling from Jakarta to Paris via Doha, but in this case the Flight from Jakarta to Doha using a relatively new Boeing 787. This is my first flight with 787, cabin has fancy lighting spacious cabin luggage. The only problem is the touchscreen on the inflight that cannot navigate properly. I brought my own headset i can barely decrease volume so it is so loud by default. Let alone browsing movies. Everything else was fine, Food was fine, crew were helpful with the bags.",1
"  Los Angeles to Venice via Paris CDG, returning from Florence via Paris to Los Angeles. Outbound flight on A380 in Premium Economy. It's almost a dedicated cabin, except the restrooms are at the rear of the aircraft in economy. Crew and service good; dinner was tasty, but didn't really notice that Premium Economy was upgraded as advertised. Mid flight an ice cream bar was served which was a nice touch. Breakfast was abysmal - basically nothing but sugar and nothing even vaguely nutritious. But the biggest downfall of Premium Economy are the shell seats. They are simply tortuous to sit in for any period of time, and sleeping was just about impossible. Even though the seat reclines within the shell, you still feel like you are sitting up. And even when using an inflatable back pillow I was extremely uncomfortable. The return flight from CDG to LAX was on a Boeing 777-300ER; this time the Premium Economy cabin had two dedicated restrooms, but the crew did nothing to stop biz or economy passengers from using them. Unlike the outbound flight the crew could not have been more disinterested. After serving dinner they disappeared for 8 hours. They did not even come around with water once during the flight. And barely a smile from anybody. Supposedly there was a mid-flight snack, but it was never announced or offered. The 777 has the same shell seats, and this time they seemed to have even less recline the A380. They also have a legrest which provides a little support for your upper legs, but unless you are 4 feet tall is completely ineffective. By the end of the flight both my partner and I had back pains. Air France needs to learn from Cathay and ditch the horrible shell seats. Until that happens we will fly Virgin even if it means the inconvenience of flying through London because it is a far superior product in both comfort and service.",0
  High quality service and great dining options always make for an enjoyable flight. QR42 to Doha was no exception in this regard. I would highly recommend Qatar Airways who set the benchmark for premium service in business class.,1
" Mumbai to Tokyo Narita with ANA in a B787 configured in only two classes. Cabin interior was welcoming and immaculately maintained. The Business Class configuration is among the best, allowing for a degree of privacy not offered in most other airlines. Service levels were exceptional strengthening ANA's reputation as one of the top 5 airlines in the world. The flight attendants were attentive yet discreet. All I can say is, flying with ANA in Business is a pleasure.",1
"  Food offerings at Seoul Asiana lounge rather poor, the wing lounge at Hong Kong airport much better. Food ex Seoul was good, ex HKK rather mediocre. Service seats and entertainment system excellent.",1
"  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues. Despite all those little negatives, Emirates is still a top notch experience.",1
"  Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.",1
"  Very rude call centre people once they take your money from card you are abandoned as no help you get from them. Flights have been cancelled, no email notification, no live information, no refund after 3 months! This is the last time I am using them.",0
"  I flew Hong Kong to Seoul with Cathay Pacific with Oneworld Sapphire status. Check in was quick. I entered The Wing straight away, it was getting crowded as times went pass as many Europeans and Australians customers have a connecting flight to Europe, Australia, China and rest of Asia. Boarding was quick, it was a reconfigured aircraft with a touchscreen TV and a shelf underneath it. The seat was comfortable but I think it might not be if traveling long distance as the seats were not tall enough. There were two options for breakfast: congee and western brunch. I got the brunch and my mum got the congee, I tasted both and it was both nice, but I think the portion was not enough. Cabin staff were hardworking and friendly, but some were not talkative and somehow robotic. We paid HKD4400 for both of us in this journey (return) so it was attractive and I highly recommend Cathay Pacific.",1
"  Kuala Lumpur to Dubai. Have flown Emirates numerous time over the last few months and been very happy with service, comfort and quality of food. This last trip was exceptional and I had to give a shout out to the cabin crew. We had one of the best travel experiences and we fly extensively throughout North America and UAE.  I highly recommend Emirates.

"  Seoul Incheon to Amsterdam. I was satisfied with this flight overall. Check in process was friendly and efficient at Incheon airport, even though I arrived with less than an hour until departure. The seat was quite comfortable for a long trip, with plenty of leg room. I would say that the entertainment is not as good as on many other international airlines, but better than Asiana, with a reasonably interesting range of movies but a fairly lousy range of TV shows. I ordered a gluten free meal and was quite happy with the quality - probably one of the better GF meals I've had on a plane, but unfortunately Korean airlines don't seem to ever manage to provide GF bread. The range of drinks was okay, but again, I think it's smaller than many other international carriers, even in economy. The flight attendants serving my aisle were friendly and personable and made a real effort to interact with the passengers in a warm way - this was the most impressive part of the experience for me. Plane arrived on time in Paris and the toilets were kept clean for the whole trip.",1
  Manila to New York via Tokyo. I am very happy with the service and cleanliness of this aircraft! ANA and the FAs are very helpful and accommodating. They are also helpful during the flight not only with my baby but other babies too. They are mindful to our needs as a family and always courteous and polite.,1
"  Always fly Korean Air nonstop when I visit friends and family in Atlanta. Last trip 2015. Used Gangnam City Terminal checkin which allowed for expedited security at ICN. At ATL, checkin is always hassle free with no wait when you use the web check in line. Seats still extremely spacious with leg room, flexible headrest and recline. I managed to sleep 7-8 hours in both directions! Cabin spotless. Crew friendly, professional and polite in both English and Korean. Entertainment options are a bit lacking, honestly. Oddly, only four Korean movies. Food quality (Korean choices) are tasty, too.",1
"  Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in Düsseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.",1
  Singapore to San Francisco. Initially when I flew on an A350 I felt that it was far too narrow unlike B777-300 ER. It's actually a very quiet plane and the seats are very comfortable. The lighting is very conducive especially for an overnight flight. However as I took SQ32 which was a morning flight out of Singapore it was some time before the cabin lights were switched off and when it does this is a super cool silent plane allowing one to relax and doze off to sleep and even when the lights are being switched on it was not like super glaring. Great plane and great flight and I did arrive fresher on this flight not when I flew on this aircraft for the first time in March than I would do on other types of aircraft.,1
"  Aircraft was changed which meant I did not have an aisle access and would have to climb over someone to get out of my seat. They should have informed of this change to give us time to make other arrangements. In the end crew changed me to a seat with no one next to me but by the wing, having had 1K. Crew was brilliant and apologetic but they should have told us. Food was mediocre. I do not see why they are a 5 star airline.",0
  Beirut to Washington via Paris. Last time traveling with this airline. On our way to Beirut in June 26 they messed up our flight and took us forever to get there. And today we had a 7:40 wait at airport they added a delay of 3 hours and now another hour. They lost my daughter’s luggage at their airport (she was traveling on different airlines) but they were lost at Charles De Gaulle because of a strike and they were of no help whatsoever. Never again fly Air France or connect through Paris.,0
" Boarding was fast and smooth. Nice warm smiley welcome on board. Aircraft interior looked not that clean and shows its age well. IFE was excellent, so were the crew members, though it seemed at times that they were rushing the service. I pre-ordered Indian vegetarian option and I was served. Crew came over again for the drinks and when I asked if they have anything diet, one of the crew member actually went out of his was to find me a coke zero. Washrooms were kept clean through out the flight. Breakfast was adequate. I was really impressed how attentive crew were to one passenger who wasn't feeling good and vomit almost the entire flight. Overall, as expected, well served and fed flight.",1
"  I believe that a 5 star airline should show consistency in the service provided. After a great flight to Europe with Cathay Pacific I had a pretty bad experience with a regional flight. They announced a 4 hour delay at BKK airport. For this I received a vouched of 70HKD (yes 70) for a ""dinner"" in one of the outlets. My hunt for an outlet that was happy to accept it has been pretty long. After a long but nice wait at their new lounge I boarded and surprise - the aircraft is fitted with the hard shell seats. The worst recline ever experienced. I believe that European low cost airlines have bigger recline than this ""premium"" airline. As often happens with CX the food was not good for western's taste. And as often happens they underestimated (or under communicate) the actual scale of the delay, being almost one hour longer than officially stated. From a premium airline I expect more.

"   Although the aircraft is good with flat beds and the crew is good, the onboard selection of entertainment does not compare to other airlines. The meals are low quality for Business class. Also I find the seats not as comfortable as others.",0
"  San Francisco to Budapest via Istanbul. Do not use Turkish Airlines, the worst company I have flown with. I had to stay in Istanbul 16 hours because the mistakes that the company employees made and when I wanted to talk with somebody from customer service they were very rude turned their back and ignored me. I was traveling from San Francisco to Budapest with Romanian papers and they didn't allow me to board the plane in Istambul to Budapest because I didn't have a visa. Romania is part of EU we do not need visas to travel any were in Europe. But this guys didn't get it, so I had to buy a different plane ticket to Romania and of course because of that all my return tickets to San Francisco were cancelled and I had to pay another $1400 for a new ticket. And what is the company answer to all of this? ""Carrier shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of carrier to any passenger"" My first and last time flying with this company.",0
"  Amsterdam to Singapore. This was a new A350 which was recently put in service. The seats were slightly narrower than the older business class seats; however in my opinion this does not decrease the comfort level. The seats were very comfortable and there were a lot of storage space for my belongings (to the point that we have to check every space before we leave the plane). The touch screen function is quite new from SQ and this made a lot of difference as older remotes can me quite tough to press as the plane ages. Service on the cabin was very good as usual; food was fantastic cabin crew were friendly and gracious. They were especially helpful towards by two parents, one with a wheelchair and the other less tech savvy with the entertainment system. Business class in SQ these days do not get much personal items given in the business class giveaway bag (compared to say LX and AY). However as this year was the 70th anniversary of SQ we were given a special leather bag.",1
"  My wife and me were on our holiday trip to USA and taken SQ32 on 31/3 in SIA business Class seat 15D & F. We are happy with the check in and boarding. It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers (salmons & prawns) were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have, I’ve chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years.  Not the cabin crew’s fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful. We totally enjoy the flight in business class especially my wife as this is her first time in business class and she enjoy the new business class seat a lot as she was I totally worried that she could not sleep but the food down seat converted to bed was comfortable for her to sleep in.

"  Newark to Athens. The flight left on time but was disorganized trying to get people on board. Took them a long time simply bringing drinks to the passengers. Also, if you sign up for their frequent flyer program, make sure you check that they give you your miles. They said it was my responsibility to make sure they give me my miles. Never had any kind of problems like this with the other airlines I have flown with. Very bad customer service.",0
"  The staff were most helpful and delightful, especially Joanne, Lilin, Thiagesan and Edward. I can’t say enough for their warm hospitality, and being very friendly and capable in their jobs.",1
"  Hong Kong to Cape Town. Never experienced such unprofessional and rude service. About 3 hours before arrival in Cape Town breakfast was served. Hostess asked my husband if he wants Conpoy Congee with beef stroganoff or omelette, he replied omelet please. She gave him the Congee. When opened he saw it's not the omelet. She was then just serving the row behind us. He informed her he got the wrong one and asked to switch for the omelette. She grabbed the container out of his hand literally threw the omelette infront of him. My husband and I were both shocked. I wanted to do something about it but my husband asked me to leave it for now. We were both very tired after almost 15 hour flight. They do not have name tags so I did not get her name. ",0
"  Booked a wheelchair service from Milan to Bangkok. Apart from a slight mishap in Singapore this was one of the best flights I have ever had. The quality of the service was outstanding. Crew worked throughout unlike many European airlines, with great attentiveness. I know because I never sleep. The quality of the food was superb. From my experience both Singapore airlines and Thai have the best training I have come across. Very good entertainment system with many choices. As a yearly flyer there is nothing better than having a long flight where everything works smoothly and people care about you. I can only say thank you. I appreciate your hard work. I will be flying with you again later this year.",1
"  Hong Kong to Paris CDG. I am a little bit skeptical about Cathay. It is clearly a top airline and perhaps their CDG-HKG-CDG route is not highly strategic. HKG airport lounge first class lounge is far away from boarding gate. No announcement was made of the flight delay, and as you are not escorted to the plane (this service is standard procedure for some airlines) you end up waiting before a closed boarding gate! Luckily there was a closer Business class lounge (named the bridge I think), which proved perhaps more comfortable than the First class one. I decided to have them wait for me and didn’t move until they called my name (I was naughty but it was very late). The seat is extremely comfortable. Once transformed into your bed, it is very large.  A special mention for the pyjama. Flight attendants were very nice. The night ambiance of the plane was standard and I missed the privacy of Air France curtains or Singapore airline sliding doors. Breakfast was not memorable but I am very picky with breakfast.",1
"  I recently had the pleasure of flying with Japan Airlines and I have to say that it was an outstanding experience from start to finish. I booked my ticket through Delhi Office. Here one employee made the process seamless and efficient. He went extra to help me book Airport Hotel in Tokyo as well as getting my frequent flyer points credit on timely manner. Upon arriving at the airport, I was greeted by friendly staff who made the check-in process a breeze. The airport lounge was comfortable and well-equipped, with plenty of amenities to keep me occupied while I waited for my flight. Once on board, the flight crew was professional and attentive. They made sure that all passengers were comfortable and provided excellent in-flight service. The plane itself was clean and well-maintained, with comfortable seats and plenty of legroom. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Indian food and drinks offered on the flight. I am vegetarian and food was exceptionally good. Overall, I would highly recommend Japan Airlines to anyone looking for a hassle-free and enjoyable flying experience. They truly go above and beyond to ensure that their passengers have a comfortable and enjoyable journey.",1
"  When boarding I realized the plane was changed without being notified at check-in. Instead of single window seat on an A350 I got a neighbor next to me on an old B777. After take-off the massage function went on and could not be switched off. The apologetic cabin crew director tried to help, rebooted the system several times but could not fix the problem. As there was no other seat available, I had to stay in my allocated seat and I ended up sitting upright, where the impact of the massage was a bit less then in any other position. Instead off sleeping in my bed/seat I got a massage for the 6 hour flight. The experience was like a joke, although the crew was friendly and apologizing. ",0
"  I am a regular flyer of Qatar Airways, and every time I fly I enjoy an unmatched experience. The experience starts right from the time you visit their user-friendly website for ticketing / check-in or for any changes you wish to make. The Airport lounge is one of the best among many I have visited in other countries. The in-flight ambience and services are extraordinary. Also they take care of all the safety aspects from embarking till disembark. ",1
"  On the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Turkey and on the return flight, the air conditioning was very cold, super uncomfortable cold. My wife and I both returned home with flu like symptoms, I received anti biotics for a chest infection from the long flight under such cold conditions. I was wearing suitable long pants, long sleeve shirt, jumper yet still felt cold with the airline blanket on. My wife used two blankets and still was cold the entire flight. I've flown many long haul flights with other airlines and never has the cabin temp been so so cold.",0
"  Manchester to Hong Kong. The best airline, I have been flying with them for last pass four year and the service on board are just great. Lounges are great and staff are pleasing. On board the business class seat are great - 1x2x1 is the best layout.",1
"  Our flight from Amsterdam to Dubai was delayed and we missed our second flight because of that. In the airport, they offered us a new ticket and we had to stay in the airport overnight. The airport was not suitable for a family stay, and we could not use the lounge with a economy ticket. The airport staff were rude and they did not do much to help. They gave us vouchers for dinner, but the restaurant that we went (Gallery) gave us the lowest quality of food with that voucher. Will never make a mistake like this again. The only positive thing was the little gift for my kid in the plane.",0
"  FRA-DOH-SIN return. My first time onboard the ""best airline“ and I wasn’t disappointed. Qatar offers a high level of service and comfort from beginning to the end oft the journey. I was concerned about the chaotic situation at European airports this summer, but check-in and security at Frankfurt were fast and efficient. Transfer at Doha Hamad was very good too. QR’s onboard product is amazing with a professional crew, comfortable seats, good IFE and delicious meals. However meal service was a bit inconsistent: a welcome drink was only offered during the FRA-DOH flight, while only during the SIN-DOH flight there was no coffee service after the meal. And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900. I definitely prefer the A350 because seats are wider, IFE has more content, the inflight map and the ambience / design is better. Overall a very good experience for a low price.",1
"  Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing.",0
"  This is the worst airline. The airline preponed my flight and I had 22 hrs transit in Istanbul. Above all, I accepted the offer because I had an emergency and I needed to fly anyway. They did not give any information beforehand, I tried to contact the service center and even went to the airport to find someone at the service desk if possible but it almost impossible to communicate with the airline. I tried to request the staff through telephone they convinced me that my request for a hotel room in Istanbul airport will be accepted. when I reached the airport for check-in they demanded that I need to apply for an e-visa that would cost 120€. I was about to miss my flight but the staff was so not cooperative even the person at the service desk was very rude. However, I finally managed to get on board. I expected to get a room in the airport Hotel in Istanbul, but my request was rejected. It was the worst experience spending time in Istanbul airport for 22 hrs. Maybe because I was an economy class passenger, they treated me so badly but I think it is someway their responsibility until I reach my destination. Those 22 hrs in Istanbul airport was a trauma for me. I would not recommend traveling with this airline.",0
"  A reliable and consistent service, despite flying during a pandemic. The flight left and arrived on time. The cabin was clean, cabin crew professional and friendly. The meals offer excellent portions for a short flight. ",1
"  Wonderful flight staff, so helpful and caring, looked after all my need during the flight to Doha and Bangkok from Edinburgh, very clean and comfortable plane. Food amazing, high quality service, excellent entertainment on board and spoiled for choice. Lounge areas at all stops again excellent, staff amazing, food menu very high standard. Qatar Airways basically organise everything I could need and ensuring I had a wonderful flight.",1
"  This was my 5th experience with Singapore Airlines but very different than the other 4. We had our Mumbai to Singapore flight delayed by 5-6 hours and eventually the 2nd flight from Singapore to Melbourne too got delayed however by 8-9 hours. We were made to stay in Ramada Singapore where the lunch was not made available to us, dinner too was compromised. We had a terrible stay and food in the hotel. Overall, I would not rate my journey a pleasant one.",0
"  Busan to Singapore. First of all, the service has dramatically improved since my last trip with SIA. Cabin crews are super friendly, cheerful and serves customer with a big smile. However, the most disappointing part is the attitude of the ground staff in Busan. One of the ground staff was very impatient and does things insincerely. She delays the precious time of my travelmate by asking unnecessary documents as other ground staff does not require it. Another shocking part is the cleanliness situation of the cabin which was quite dirty and not up to SIA's standard. There were coffee stains on the tray table and the cupholder of the seat. However, the cabin crew was responsive and quickly cleaned the stain for lunch. Food was OK and when I did not finish my food, the cabin crew did asked for feedback and offered me other options which is something I appreciate. Despite the disappointment of the cleanliness and attitude of the ground staff, the cabin crew's attitude actually made my day.",1
"  I used Qatar Airways for the fourth time late in 2016, on the route Zurich – Bangkok – Zurich, in economy class. On previous flights, I had twice tried to sign on to Qatar's frequent flyer programme, but somehow this did not work out. I had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat, as I have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently. On the flight from Doha to Bangkok I was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong. I requested that I be allowed to change the seat, explaining that I might get problems, but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full. In Bangkok, I had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport.  I needed to leave Bangkok eight days earlier than booked. The ticket I had bought stated that I would be charged 173 Swiss francs for any change of reservation, but when I tried to make the change online, the cost was given as 355 Swiss francs. I called the Qatar office in Bangkok. They confirmed that this was a mistake, ""probably a software problem“, and then proceeded to charge me 202 Swiss francs. I was told that I was charged more because my change of reservation had to made manually. To me, this is not five star.",0
" London Heathrow to Dubai. The Emirates A380 is an absolute pleasure. The aircraft is a wonder of modern technology, the smoothest ride you can imagine, and the quietest cabin I have experienced. Lots of leg room, excellent cabin lighting and temperature, lots of room to walk around, and excellent inflight entertainment. A database of around 500 movies in many languages is available. You can connect your device by USB and listen to your music or watch your own movies on the bigger screen. Large windows and 3 flight cameras available all the time. In flight service reminds me of the old days when we had nice meals on planes served with metal cutlery. Inflight wifi with 20MB free of charge and mobile phone connectivity for calls. Brilliant.",1
  I found the experience very poor compared to other airlines I have used in Europe this past year. The food quality was poor. They served drinks in tiny paper cups. The snacks were fruity flavored kids drinks that were like getting a yogurt with extra sugar. You rarely saw an attendant. The inflight entertainment was very poor.,0
" I bought and paid for a Bassinet seat for me and my son. I called the pretty poor CS team to confirm prior to flying, and they assured me there would be a Bassinet seat. When I got on the flight, there was no Bassinet seat. I paid 139 euros extra for that seat. When I contacted the complaints team for a refund for them not providing me what I paid for they offered me 46 euros to compensate me. I sent over 25 complaint messages and got treated shockingly with them refusing to answer basic questions, like how did they calculate that measly refund. Very poor experience.",0
  After a two and a half hour delay (not even a water offered) there was a further delay at our transit point. I was told that my plane had left and there was a flight in several hours to my country but not my destination as they only fly there once a week. There was not even an apology offered. The staff told me it’s up to myself to find pay for a connecting flight in our country even though I’d paid Qatar in full for a ticket to my destination! After much demand they agreed to sort the final leg of our trip. We were again in our several ours at transit destination not offered anything. We had to demand some food and water and it was a fight to get a bit of airplane food and water! ,0
"  Munich to Mexico City via Paris CDG. The check in in MUC went smooth and rather quick. The agent even accepted my 2 kg luggage overweight without complaining what was really great. The seat pitch on the A318 is horrible, very cramped. It was ok for the one-hour-leg but this is not premium level. Boarding the A380 in CDG was very smooth. I paid for a seat with extra leg room at an emergency exit on the upper deck. The cabin is very nice yet there is a 2-3-2 seat configuration. Although I had great leg room, the seats were horrible. I’m rather a huge person and it was very cramped in the sweat because the armrest in one side is immovable because the tray table is in it. The seats are very hard and uncomfortable for a 12h flight. After six hours I had a sore back and wasn’t able to sit anymore. The cabin has to be updated urgently! The staff on this flight was amazing, very friendly, permanently smiling and very attentive! The service was quick and drinks were offered during the whole flight. I ordered a gluten free special meal and I was served first. The quality of the food was good for economy standards. Flight was on time at all legs. I would definitely fly AF again but only on flights till 6 hours. For any longer flight the current seats on the 380 aren’t designed.",1
"  Colombo to Dubai. I wasn't blown over by the service orthe food. The plane was old and dated and tv screen didn't work, the rest of the staff weren't very polite and seemed tired and grumpy. I managed to put one movie on, but the screen was blurry and the movie was different than the original. The first leg was a better much newer plane with a working screen, the staff were politer and the food was better. Each time I fly with Emirates, the service goes downhill.",1
  Singapore to Istanbul and return. The seats are worn out but okay. The main problem was the cabins were extremely overheated.  I asked a couple of times if they could turn down the temperature but they never did. On a 13 hr haul feeling cooked is very unpleasant. I couldn't fly again with Turkish. ,0
"  Incheon to Bangkok. After flying from Hawaii to Bangkok several times with Korean Air, I can say that there is nothing very impressive about this airline. It's not that anything is especially awful, but it's my impression that the company and its personnel are several rungs below their competitors. They lack the charm, cleverness, efficiency, and poise of other airlines, and are often lax and simply sloppy. On one recent flight, a member of the cabin staff spilled a tray of drinks on me while he was serving them to other passengers; on another recent flight, I was exiting the toilet and a flight attendant was literally running up the aisle and ran straight into me and knocked me out of the way and, without stopping, yelled, ""oops!"" and shrugged and carried on running. Their Thai staff are by far their best. Korean Air's catering is unappetizing, the interiors of their aircraft are uncomfortable, and their uniforms look something like pajamas. The entertainment on board is limited, dull and needs improvement fast and, most surprisingly for such a supposedly technologically-advanced country, Korean Air's website and app are clumsy and not at all user friendly. The airlines likes to make choosing a seat as difficult as possible and it's now only possible to do so when signed in as a member of the airline's frequent flier program, despite my preference for earning mileage with one of their codeshare partners. Does Korean Air know what codesharing actually is? Finally, Incheon airport is new, but beyond shopping there's actually not much to do and it's not very much fun. So, in short, nothing awful, but Korean Air is far, far behind ANA, JAL, EVA air, Thai Airways and Singapore Airlines, and can only really compete by being cheap.",0
"  Dublin to Sydney via Doha. The flight got me there safe and sound. I wasn’t offered drinks between meals while I was awake. My USB port wasn’t working, the seat was cramped and cannot recline properly. On my return trip I wasn’t offered my second meal during the flight from Dublin to Doha. When I express my displeasure, staff said I was asleep and they didn’t want to disturb my sleep. They offer me a box of chocolate to appease me, and make sure the crew member of my next leg to look after me.  Would have been better if they had upgraded me.",0
"  Newark to Athens. Emirates far exceeds the services provided by US carriers. I needed to change my travel dates due to a family emergency, and the ticket agent waved the change fees, allowing me to depart for Athens within the day. The service on board both ways included two full meals, nice reusable amenity kits with shades, earplugs, socks and toothpaste/toothbrush, the seats were comfortable, and the bar service featured top-shelf brands. The in-flight entertainment system was also top notch, with cameras built in to the front of the plane to provide you with a cockpit view. Economy passengers are also offered a certain amount of free wifi, which was more than enough to communicate with friends and family on the ground to inform them of my flights progress. If all of that is not enough, Emirates allows economy passengers to check in 2 bags for free!",1
 Worst possible ground service I have experienced. The staff were rude and not aware of the many visa policy changes and insists on being right though proven otherwise through official government channels. And flights not on time.,0
" Boarding on time. Warm welcome onboard. Plane was spotless. Air France, as usual, middle seat was empty so plenty of room in economy. Lunch was served promptly after the aircraft reached the cruising altitude. Cabin crew was very apologetic for not having a second meal option available by the time they reached my row. Food quantity and quality was superb; butter, cheese, French dessert. It would be nice if the bread roll was warmed up a bit before serving. IFE is ok, need a bit more diversity when it comes to TV/Films, though music collection was plenty. Lights were off after lunch, many passengers took an opportunity to sleep. Washrooms were kept spotless throughout the flight and back galley was well-equipped with little snacks and candies and drinks. An hour before the landing, snack box were distributed consisted of hummus sandwich, yogurt drink, muffin and coffee/tea. What makes AF the best is their crew, perfectly bilingual, smiley and warm, neat and tidy, problem solvers rather than ignorers.",1
"  Tokyo Narita to Singapore. A very comfortable flight, with very attentive flight attendants, who were friendly and not intrusive. Put on a genuine smile. Meal was superb. Had fried chicken on steam rice, with good sides as well. Tasty but not oily. Kabosu, which is the airline's own drink creation of lime and honey, is really good and refreshing. The leg room seemed more generous than I have seen on other airlines. Highly recommend ANA if you are flying to Japan. Excellent service and products.",1
"  Istanbul to Ankara. A Boeing 777 for a short haul flight of about 45 mins - you do not see that everyday but I was pleased to be in my favorite aircraft anyway. However, dealing in full-board service with a large aircraft for a short haul was problematic for both cabin crew and passengers alike. Meal was a special Ramadan box, including a soup and additional drink, so I am not sure if everyone could get their boxes. Extremely nervous crew could not come back to collect the garbage and we were told to throw them on the floor while landing! I would prefer their usual short haul panini, rather than the Ramadan box anyway. Poor ground service combined with amazingly long taxi duration of new Istanbul airport. 45 mins delay in boarding time and 45 mins of taxi for a 45 mins of flight time? That surely was a weird flight.",1
"  A very pleasant flight with Emirates from Dubai to Dublin. A very nice continental breakfast was served after departure. The staff were very polite, friendly and efficient. The IFE worked well and was very extensive. A delicious meal was served later. I was particularly impressed by the trouble the staff took with passengers with babies.",1
"  Could not fly in March 2020 because Covid. Spent over $1400 for the ticket, now they are telling me that I can only get $131 refund. Can't get voucher or miles too. So Turkish Airlines is stealing passenger's money or they want people to risk their life flying last year? One thing for sure, I will never book a ticket with Turkish Airlines again.",0
"  Dubai to Manila. Emirates seems to be an airline where economy passengers are more important than business class passengers.  All hand carry was measured and weighed also for business class passengers. This is the first time on over 200 long haul business class flights I have ever experienced this. Reason: Business class is full of economy class passengers being upgraded. B777 is a wide body wide aircraft with 2 entrances. All economy passengers seated on the 2 aisle are boarded through the front door and has to pass through business class to get to their seat. As a business class passenger this means a lot of noise and commotion, no service until boarding is complete and being hit several times by carry on luggage. No service/bad service continued through out the flight with no drinks being offered during meals and no attention to passengers at all. It seemed the flight was understaffed due to a full business class.",0
"  Manila to San Francisco via Taipei. Great Flight, definitely recommend. Spacious leg room for economy Class, good food and clean rest rooms. Just improve on the the Inflight entertainment and everything Will be perfect. Definitely my kind of airline.",1
"  
I flew with them on the 24th March 2023. What a great service and the Airline rep Debbie was so helpful and friendly and she helped us to do a very smooth check-in. I have to say it was 5 star service all the way from London to Bangkok and back and I cannot wait to fly with them again. Thank you for such a great service and looking forward to fly with you again.

"  Overbooked my international flight and somehow I got on standby. After not being able to get anyone to take their offer of 400 euros, hotel, and accommodations, they bumped us all to the next day. Afterwards the customer service was extremely rude ... saying how they have no patience for anyone because they have to deal with bumped passengers everyday. While we were told we were getting the same offer as the other passengers, our accommodations and meal met the bare minimum legal requirements. Our hotel was over 1 hour outside of the city. No toilet paper. Not a nice hotel and very far away from anything. The free meal consisted of cold mashed potatoes, pasta, and cold cuts. In order to get the 400 euros we need to leave a message on their feedback forum and hope to get a response in a week. I'm staying in the shabbiest hotel I've ever stayed in while I have a very nice hotel booked and paid for at my destination. I will never fly Turkish Airlines again. ",0
"  Cairo to San Francisco with a connection in Istanbul. The flight from Cairo was delayed, which made us too late to make the connection in Istanbul. The worst part is that in Istanbul, they put the arriving on a passengers on a slow bus instead of a tarmac to reach the gate and makes it easy to miss the connecting flights. After missing the connection, we had to spend about another 90 minutes at the customer service desk to get on the flight the next day. Turkish Airlines did pay for the hotel stay as well as dinner and breakfast, but it was still an inconvenience. Then, on the flight the next day, there was yet another delay due to mechanical errors. Unbelievable how unpleasant this flight was.",0
"  Superb service on both flights. They seemed happy to serve and did not have the fake smile. Food good as far as airline food goes. Snacks served during flight from JNB-HKG. Was dreading the 10 abreast seating on B777 and even though the seat is a little narrower, I found the seat cushion comfortable. Head rest also good. The toilets were clean. Overall a very good experience. The HKG-BKK flight was also excellent. Friendly and engaging crew. Good breakfast served. No complaints. Highly recommended.",1
"  Flew Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London Heathrow. First time in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Yes and No. Firstly the good points. Seat is slightly larger, with 38 inch pitch, reclines 8 inches. Food Prawn or Lamb, not usual Chicken or Beef. You get a menu, wine is served from the bottle. TV screen is larger. Lights go off quicker than economy. Bad points, is it worth 3x the price?, depends on how full the plane is, if it is empty in economy then probably no. Configuration of 4 seats in middle is poor, economy 3 seats. The seat pitch could be more, Cathay used to have 34 inch pitch in economy, now 31 inch, so 3x for an extra 3 original inches is not good, buying two seats in economy would give you more room. Interesting class of seat, not all airlines offer.",1
"  We flew Air France from Miami to Warsaw connecting in Paris. Air France has only one round trip a day from Miami to Paris. I had been tracking the flights for three weeks before our departure date, on flightradar. Most of the time the incoming flight was late.  On July 11, 2018, I received a text message from Air France at approximately 10:30 AM stating that our fight would be delayed one hour, from 7:40 PM to 8:40 PM. The plane departed at 10 PM, two and twenty minutes late.  We arrived in Paris forty minutes before our connecting fight to Warsaw. The plane sat on the runway for approximately twenty minutes, because our gate was not available. I cannot understand why this flight could not have been assigned another gate. Most of the people around me missed their connecting flights, like me. We ran as fast as we could to the connecting flights gate. We arrived ten minutes before flight departure time, but the gate closes twenty minutes before departure. We went to customer service, with long lines and few people working behind the counter. The first connecting flight to Warsaw was filled. They put us on the second connection, approximately six hours later. Thirty minutes after getting my connecting flight changed, I received a text message that I missed my original connecting flight, brilliant. In my opinion Air France could care less about their Miami/Paris, one round trip a day. Their customer service needs a lot of improvement. This was my first and last time to fly Air France. ",0
"  Turkish Airlines flight from Miami to Manila via Istanbul. Terrible experience. My TV screen's touchpad and remote both didn't work. The food cart and some staff kept bumping against my seat. The food was decent, but they had to give me what I hadn't asked for because they had run out. Tried to connect to the wifi, but it seems like they don't accept international credit cards.",0
"  Milan to Jakarta via Doha in October 2017. We boarded the A330-300, staff with friendly smiles and got to our seat 23F which was a window seat, at the seat was IFE, and coat hook but no USB charger. This A330-300 was an older one. We took off on time, the meal service options were roast chicken with potatoes or beef stew, I chose the chicken which wasn't the best. I tried to sleep but due to cramped legroom I couldn't, so I took a walk, I got back to my seat and started to watch the IFE, but it was small but had a lot of options. We landed at Hammad International airport 30 minutes late, had a 2 hour layover before boarding the Boeing 787-8 to Jakarta, again the legroom was cramped but this time the IFE had a USB charger, so I could charge my phone. I woke up just before landing, we landed on time at Jakarta. ",0
"  Jakarta to Istanbul. TK 57 left Jakarta airport earlier than schedule. The service level was similar when we returned back home on TK56. On both flights, cabin and toilets were clean and staff were nice. Food was in big portion and we are pleased to have it. Inflight amenities were sufficient. During this flight we did not get ice cream like Asian airlines.  My other inputs are that menu for flights from Istanbul. Please serve any other menu from elsewhere. We had enough Turkish meal during our long visit in Turkey and please train your staff to speak better English. Yes they are nice and polite and speak English but just a little effort to speak better and I am sure Turkish airlines can do it.",1
"  While boarding my flight from Copenhagen to Doha, I was told my name had been cancelled from the flight for some unknown technical reason and they reissued my boarding pass at the gated.  At my assigned seat, ground staff came into the flight to ask me for my luggage tags and went out for a few minutes before returning back to the flight to tell me ok luggage is in. Before boarding my flight from Doha to Singapore, I asked if my luggage is on the flight but the person on the counter scolded me for holding on to my husband’s flight ticket saying that he should hold it himself cause I might lose it.  On the flight, I saw that my chicken dish had some aluminium foil still on it. They staff said sorry and said they would write report and gave me fruits. Entertainment system had to be rebooted during the flight lasting over ten minutes.",0
  Budapest to Singapore via Doha. We flew with our two babies and the crew was extremely helpful and understanding on the whole journey. The upgraded airport in Doha is also very pleasant.,1
"  This flight from Doha to Hong Kong took off from the Middle East at the awkward time of 3.30 am. On boarding the nice stewardess greeted me and hung my jacket. After taking off it was meal time, and I was given the option of eating on awakening. The seat was comfortable, and the breakfast was good though the congee that I took as Main is not Chinese style. Throughout the flight and service are smooth and comfortable. And this after relaxing at the beautiful lounge at Doha airport. A first class flight.

" Washington to Doha. Despite all the rave reviews of the Q-Suite, I really don’t like it. While having a single seat by the window is always great and the door is good for privacy, it is not good for sleeping. I can’t bend my knees and the tray table, when closed and stowed, takes away several inches of space. On board service is the usual QR high standard. First and business class immigration clearance in DOH is nice This was an award points trip for me which I had to book almost a year in advance in order to use my points balance before expiration. I found Privilege Club a poor mileage program, inconvenient to use when booking non-QR flights with other One World carriers. You cannot see award inventory online. Rather, you have to send in a request and wait 24 hours to find out if there is availability. ",1
"  We flew from KL back to Doha on 20 March on Business Class and the in-flight service was fantastic! Everyone taking care of us from the moment we stepped on the plane had a lovely personality and manner about them. They were all very helpful, had a great smile and provided good information about the business class suites and with selecting our drinks and food for the flight. We would like to extend a very special Thank You to the staff who really stood out with their customer service attitude and made our almost 8hour flight very pleasant. Well done Qatar Airways.",1
"  Manchester to Singapore via Doha. Flight from Doha to Singapore delayed by almost 3 hours as we arrived in Doha. I had to ask the transfer counter as my onward journey from Singapore will be affected. One agent at the transfer counter listened to me and calmly suggested another flight to my final destination. She changed my second flight and I finally got to my final destination yesterday, although 2 hours later. I would like to thank her for listening calmly and then to offer a different flight. She is a true gem indeed and this reflects well on Qatar Airways. Unlike other transfer staff who didn't listen and just gave us a meal voucher without explaining or listening to the customers. Thanks to her professionalism, this review is getting a decent rating although my second flight was delayed. If only all staff can treat customer as professional and courteous as she did, despite delays and disgruntled customers, Qatar Airways will continue to do well.",1
"  Melbourne to Venice via Dubai. I have been flying Emirates for many years and always praised and recommend it. Not this time. And I am very angry and disappointed. I was wheelchair bound and when I arrived at the check in at Melbourne all seemed fine... until I have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate, gate 11 empty, alone and abandoned there. No water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as I needed assistance. When finally an attendant arrived to open the gate, I asked her if I could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and I had to go to another area. I was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. She felt terrible for what I experienced but could not do much about it. She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while “parked” while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait. The guy brought me to another plane where I was left, and almost missed my flight to Venice! When I received an alert from Emirates to go straight to the gate I tried to get attention again!!)!  Arrived at the gate they changed  my seat. Previously I had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and I thought the change was similar. Instead they moved me to seats whose armrest was fixed and could not be lifted making it impossible for my leg to rest flat on the other seats. ",0
"  I was flying from Paris to Athens on 20th July at 20:30, in the gate they changed the departure hour at least three times, we finally enter the plane at 21:40 and we were waiting inside the plane at least two hours before the plane Fly. Totally unacceptable and I don’t think I will fly with them again.",0
"  On 09 November 2019 I flew with Qatar Airways from Doha to Karachi, everything was perfect including dinner, check in and immigration because I'm living and working in Qatar since 4 Years, however no IFE due to 02 hours journey and I arrived in Karachi before schedule time. ",1
" Doha to Jakarta. I don’t understand why in Doha the airplanes have to be parked so far away from the terminal. The communication of the ground staff with the bus drivers was not efficient and clear. Extremely friendly crew, very attentive to Privilege customer and very helpful with a fragile piece of luggage.",1
"  Firstly, canceled flights departing Athens to Perth leaving us stranded in Athens for a night so we had to get accomodation. Then you had my booked with a 14 hour stop over in Dubai which is unacceptable. I requested this to be changed and it was to a later flight which worked better. I was reassured my partners flight had been linked (we had separate bookings) and that we were both on the new flight together (this was via virtual chat). We arrive at the airport to check in and even though he had received flight confirmation we were told he didn’t have tickets so we had to go get this sorted at the emirates desk. We’re both finally on the same flight only to be told we cannot be seated together on either of the flights even though we booked months ago and had already selected our seats together. The man at Athens airport checking us in did not care or try to assist us. Absolutely terrible experience and now my partner and I get to sit alone on an 11 hour flight. Completely unacceptable and very poor form from Emirates. I want a refund or some form of compensation for the hotel, meals in Athens whilst stranded and the stress of this whole situation. Completely ruined the end of our trip. I will never fly with them again.",0
"   Los Angeles to Singapore, 16.5hrs overnight. 2 adults, 3 children (7yrs, 5yrs and 8 months old) at gate \i am told that the entertainment system does not work. 4 rows of seats are not working. in flight for 16.5hrs, no lights as windows required to be shut, no lights on the seats, not charger for phone, no entertainment, they offered me to move my 2 kids to the back of the airplane so they can watch movies, I guess they have no children. then offered me ~$110 USD voucher to use on the flight for the inconvenience. I had to play with my kids, draw and color using my phone flashlight, my wife feeding my 8mths old with her phone flashlight. This was Premium Economy seats that do not cost few dollars??  I complained and their response was, ""you received a voucher for the inconvenience and you rejected the two available seats.""  I understand some issues are out of their control such as the system not operating but a $110 for the inconvenience, also, on the way back, our system works, but other passengers experience the same. Completely disappointed with Singapore Airlines Customer Relations. Will not travel with them again.",0
"  A direct flight from Dublin to Istanbul, which is often used for connections onwards to Asia or Africa, but this was solely for the purpose of visiting Istanbul. Turkish Airlines have gathered a very good reputation for themselves and this flight was no exception. The planes were extremely clean, the flight was on time, staff friendly and the entertainment very good. The food was also very nice, and is something they have been trying to constantly improve – they even make an air steward(ess) dress like a chef for the duration of the flight! Turkish delights handed out on take-off, as well as warm towels prior to landing. My only issue was with the price which was higher than average, but that was purely driven by the time of the flight (school holiday season). Classy airline due to their very satisfactory economy class service.",1
  Seattle to Taipei. EVA Air Boeing 777-300ER is very good aircraft and I feel really comfortable. The cabin crew are friendly. The Elite Class has really nice seats and food and it's a amazing journey. I will choose EVA Air next time.,1
"  Absolutely the best Tokyo to Sydney option. It does use Narita as opposed to Haneda, but JAL certainly makes up for the slight inconvenience due to the distance to the city. Firstly their fare is cheaper than Qantas, and even the Jetstar flight via the Gold Coast. Secondly their luggage allowance is more generous (23kg x 2 check-in) so it was a nice surprise to be able to relax at the airport baggage-free. Thirdly their staff, both ground and air, were so competent. They were efficient and knew not to disturb you unnecessarily, while keeping the signature Japanese Omotenashi mind. Also they serve you plenty of drinks and quality food, with warm breakfast. I did think the flavour was too much to the Japanese liking (e.g. they served rice-featured breakfast and no other options, if I'm not mistaken), but it was one of the best economy class meals around.  could not stress more how wonderful the spaciousness of the ""JAL Sky Wider"" seat arrangement was.  The only complaint is the range of movies and TV shows shown. Qantas offers more alternatives than JAL and ANA's typical blockbusters and Friends. Overall, JAL will be my chosen option in the future for this route, unless Qantas lowers their price, as I'm their FF member. ",1
"  Dubai to Singapore. On this flight I started to feel terribly ill. I was worried as it was quite a long flight but the staff were so accommodating to my needs. I was in a very trying situation but staff took initiative to make me feel cared for. Even when she wasn’t called for, she came to communicate with me what she could bring for me (more blankets, tea, etc) and how much longer the flight was. I expressed my concern to her about not being able to catch my next flight to Australia (my final destination) but she assured me not to worry about this, and that she would call for a medical team to help me in Singapore during transit, and that if the doctor says I’m not fit to fly, that I could catch the next flight when I feel better free of charge.

"  Me and my daughter were in Cyprus and could not leave on our Qatar Airways return ticket from Melbourne to Larnaca due to the Covid19 lockdown. However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways - We will get you home (catch cry at the moment). Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us, you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this. Thank you for flying and as one of your ground staff in Doha said ""Qatar will always keep flying no matter what"". We wish you the staff and everyone all the best.",1
"  Beijing to Tokyo was a good flight, on time. Morning 8am flight but served hot beef rice that is good. Cabin service great though the cabin staff speak little English. Have not flown JAL for a long time and it was a happy return. The Boeing 787 aircraft has innovations such as a blacking out window shade. Will use JAL on the same route again.",1
"  London to Hong Kong. It seems from this trip that Cathay Pacific have followed British Airways in cutting standards of what they give during the flight. Seat comfort is fairly standard, cramped economy class of today, but I was shocked at condition of the cabin. Many seats with damaged, torn covers, armrests dented and scratched and stains on the carpets. Worst of all is the poor food served and I would have rather a low-cost option where I could buy something decent to eat onboard. The cabin staff seemed disillusioned and unhappy in their service, and maybe they are fed up with cutbacks? Sad to see a once great airline drop to such low levels.",0
"  Oslo to Miami via Paris. Were supposed to fly the day after the US initiated the travel ban from Europe. The check-in didn't work, rescheduling didn't work and cancellation didn't work. I got the same error-message each time asking me to contact customer service. Tried to call two days in a row, but the Norwegian number didn't work. Tried to contact them on Facebook, but the response I got was that I could check in my hand baggage for free. Still haven't received any information regarding my flight, and there is no way I can contact them.",0
" I had heard a lot about Emirates and hence decided to fly with them. The cabin space looks okay, there are cabins with more space to walk around. On the Amsterdam to Dubai flight which was roughly 6.30-7 hrs - only 1 meal and a cold sandwich was served - in between there was no water served either. For such a long flight - it’s disappointing to not serve water at regular intervals - but it’s still the good part until now. Later at Dubai airport the staff were just bullies. Everyone was just asked to move from one place to other without much organisation and not respectfully but as cattleherd. There was a visually challenged man who was not shown any help or sympathy either. The connecting flight from Dubai to Bangalore just kept getting worse with people handing food parcels out by hand saying my colleague will bring the tray etc. Very very bad experience. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone especially if travelling economy class - they treat you as cattle. ",0
" I had the most infuriating experience with ANA during my recent business class flights from Korea to Japan and then from Japan to San Francisco.  I asked the flight attendant for a meal without meat. The flight attendant was surprised and didn't know what to do about it. So the flight attendant offered me a very small Knorr brand Cup of Noodle soup. On the 13-hour flight from Japan to San Francisco as we took off, I again informed the flight attendant of my dietary preferences. She promised a Sea bass meal and vegetable soup from the menu. An hour later, I was presented with a vegetable soup. Eagerly anticipating the promised Sea bass meal, I was informed that it would be served 2 hours before arriving in SF. They served cold chicken sandwiches and ramen in between, but I thought I would  wait for the sea bass. I decided to catch much-needed sleep, only to wake up to the pilot announcing our arrival in San Francisco in an hour. Panic-stricken, I dashed to the kitchen, begging for food, only to be told that the kitchen was closed. The flight attendant said with a smirk that I was asleep during their food service. When I got home, I found out about the meal request 24 hours before departure on ANA's website. I wasn't aware of it.",0
"  Bangkok to Tirana via Istanbul. The ground staff and customer service are incompetent, way worse than any low cost airline. My 70+ years old parents had to spend a day at the Istanbul airport and buy a new ticket because they couldn't get two boarding passes for two Turkish Airline flights (separate) from the check-in desk. You'd say online check-in, sure .. 'Sorry our system does not work, we're still in pre-Ataturk times'. Their luggage was sent to destination, but the 19th century system and useless staff could not handle two Turkish Airline tickets. Customer service keeps saying: 'we can't take care of luggage for two separate flights with us', even though missing the connecting flight is unrelated to luggage (which I repeated 10 times now). ",0
"  Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TK’s lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FA’s went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as “Priority” my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady. The next time I travel to Turkey, I will most likely choose a different carrier.",0
"  Cancun to Paris. Medium room for the legs. Since I am taller than 1.80m it is always difficult to have enough room. This is the first time I fly with Air France on a long route and I was surprised there was no choise for the meal (you usually have a couple of choices). Nice entertainment system, active also during the boarding, so you can start watching a movie or playing while waiting. Perfectly on time.",1
" The aircraft was modern with excellent inflight entertainment options (latest movies were available). Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area. Overall my experience has been very positive with Turkish Airlines, despite the above mentioned hiccup which they fairly rectified. I would and definitely will fly with them again.",1
"  London Heathrow to Islamabad via Doha. My father passed away following a brief illness in Pakistan. So I had to move fast and glad to have chosen Qatar Airways. They were incredibly understanding and went above and beyond to take me over and back in time. Excellent service through and through. I hope that Qatar Airways can maintain their absolutely brilliant standards, they really value their customers regardless of anything else.  Well done to all staff.",1
"  Hong Kong to London. Business class seat is okay but not matching standards of the best airlines. Lounge in HKG was okay but unbelievably crowded and no better than a pay to use facility, and the airline has cut back on food in the lounge. Onboard service was okay, but staff seemed very demotivated and just plain tired. Probably not helped by the very clear cutbacks in the business class items served inflight nowadays compared to 3 years ago. The food was awful and portions tiny, and even amenity type items seem to have suffered major cuts. It seems the airline has let financial problems filter through to what the passenger receives.",0
"  Booked to fly to New Delhi from Birmingham changing planes in Paris, one hour to make it to the next flight which is a joke considering it takes 35 minutes to pass through security. Missed connection, no help from staff and made to pay hotel €120 plus food out of pocket for €150. Flew out the next day luggage didn’t arrive till four days later. Will never use Air France again.",0
"  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times! I will continue to fly with them as they offer some of the best prices. However, i do hope to see friendlier faces in future.",1
"  Dubai to Istanbul. Cost reductions in Emirates. This is my 4th flight in a month where Emirates only served chicken for a meal. This is my second review and will keep posting as I am a frequent traveler to Dubai. The host attendant told me their classic sentence ""Sorry sir we ran out of beef"". As I was expecting this answer I stand up and asked her ""How come no one in front 5-6 did not get any beef?"".  She just could not give a logical answer other than that there is a ratio based on customers. I told her that this is a lie as it's my fourth flight I get the same response from them. Besides, I don't understand why do they give you the menu as they never have beef meal on board? It is very obvious that Emirates is doing cost reduction by serving chicken instead of beef. I have another return flight scheduled in a week. I wonder what will I get.",0
  Amsterdam to Singapore. Very good service and decent food for economy class. Air stewardesses were patient and provided great service even though I had a request nearly every hour for the first half of the 13 hour flight. I paid for an extra legroom seat and was disappointed to find that the charging points were located below the seat next to me. This is the seat that is 2nd from the exit row and next to the window. Better to sit right at the front.,1
  Sydney to Dubai. Emirates will make you pay for an exit row seat and refuse any sort of refund when they move you involuntarily at the last minute due to a broken seat. Unfortunately a very poor experience and I feel cheated out of the extra money i paid for exit row seats. I was told at the boarding gate as I was about to board that my 2 prepaid exit row seats ($360 paid extra on top of my normal ticket) has a broken entertainment unit. The boarding gate staff advised me that they can move me to a normal seat and refund me my $360. I was annoyed but confirmed with the staff member on the spot that he will ensure I get refunded. He assured me he will see to it and moved my allocated seats. 4 weeks has passed with no refund. I contacted Emirates via their website and explained my situation and they refuse to consider a refund - Basically I paid for a service that I did not receive on my booked flight. I will keep following up this matter with Emirates. They do not provide any contact details or means to contact them other than a very restrictive e-form on their website. Smart way to not have to deal with unhappy customers I would say.,0
"  Our family flew with Singapore Airlines since long time. We had experienced a wonderful service, especially for kids. We were so disappointed when travelling again this time in July 2022 from Paris to Vietnam via Singapore. Fares were very high but foods were very poor, no more gift for kids, no menu for kids, no snack during long flight. We understand that pandemic may caused difficulty for all airlines, but Singapore Airlines should not cut expenses.",0
  Excellent is word when it come to fly for 15 hr journey from Doha to Miami. Jolina was there on the flight and she really took good care of me as i was on my veg diet. She make sure i am having my special meal on time and if i need anything else she was happy to help me with the smile.,1
"  Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. Terrible customer service, very unhelpful and feel I was lied to and mislead by customer services! I would never use this company again due to there lack of compassion and unhelpful and very poor customer service. Tried to contact them they replied asking for details and my contact details! Still heard nothing back. Very poor and would not use this airline again!",0
"  CX 410, Hong Kong to Incheon on a B777-300, very punctual. Disliked the shell seat with no recline, but otherwise the flight was pleasant. Great entertainment choices and attentive staff. Breakfast was acceptable but not outstanding. CX 419 returning to HKG on a newer A330-300 with better seat which could recline. Same entertainment system. Food was not as good as expected. Some crew members were indifferent which was below the standard of normal CX crew, but the inflight service manager was very friendly and helpful. Overall CX has still been rather consistent with satisfactory services.",1
"  Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious. All-in-all another excellent flight on Emirates, an airline we've been flying regularly since they only had two or three planes!",1
"  Houston to Bangkok via Taipei. An excellent flight overall. Aircraft interior appeared fairly new and was in good condition. The 1x2x1 seat layout offers sufficient privacy. Flight crew gets extra points for keeping the bathrooms clean and tidy throughout the flights. Many airlines simply ignore this very important function. Meals were actually some of the highest quality we have experienced on all 5 star carriers. Only 2 complaints: a) Inferior entertainment offerings, which are the least favorite of all 5 star airlines. EVA definitely needs to improve its entertainment. Very disappointing. Ground service is sloppy and unprofessional. Business class passengers are offered zero boarding benefits. Boarding is just one massive crowd push with little or no direction from ground staff. EVA's boarding in Taipei is the least professional of any 5 Star airline we have flown and it was no better in Bangkok or Houston.",1
"  Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.",0
"  Boston to Colombo round trip via Dubai. First of all my transit at Dubai airport 14 hours. When i was booking my ticket I asked if I will get Hotel and meals, They said Yes But at the airport their ground people said we stop giving hotel and meals from November onwards. When I was was flying on January 2017 my transit was 20 hours, I didn't get hotel at that time too - the reason they said my ticket cost not reached $1000. I was sitting on the chair for 14 hours. The flight was miserable. Meal they were serving is horrible. They gave menu, so I decided to ask scrambled eggs, they said we don't have, Lunch I asked Fish that was in the menu they said they don't have, gave me Turkey which i don't eat. I am so disappointed.",0
"  Even with Silver Marco Polo club status, I was lucky enough to get an upgrade from Premium economy to Business for the 5hr flight to Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific seem to do a great job of looking after their frequent flyers. The lounge at Haneda is a haven of peace and calm and a great place to relax. Even though it was a 4 class Boeing 777, the plane appeared full. Departure and arrival on time. Professional, welcoming and attentive staff throughout the flight. Only complaint was the (Chinese) main course of the meal that was rather gloopy and unappealing, although the rest of the service was very good.",1
"  Sydney to London via Doha. Unfortunately there were quite a number of screaming children in our vicinity on the 15 hour flight to Doha, which made sleep difficult. That's not the airline's fault of course, and the cabin crew did an excellent job. Food was very good and drinks were brought around very frequently throughout the flight. Child meal was a hit with our daughter. Large and clear IFE screens. Very good selection of movies and tv shows. Seats in economy are excellent: wider than any economy seat I've seen and good legroom. The cabin crew on the Doha to London were exceptional. Our daughter suffered a bout of travel sickness and the crew were extremely helpful and went out of their way to cheer her up. Excellent flights with an excellent airline.",1
"  ANA continues to deliver outstanding service both on the ground and in the air. The flight attendants take care of one's every need. Very obliging and incredibly polite. My business class seat was very comfortable and allowed me to sleep for some time on this evening flight into Bangkok which takes some 7 hours. And the food is some of the best available. Unless you don't enjoy Japanese food, always select the Japanese over the Western meal. The dinner they served was one of the best I have ever had on an aircraft.",1
" Dublin to Auckland via Doha. Have flown numerous times with numerous airlines and Qatar Airways takes first place in exceptional service in every way from booking to being able to choose seats for free, choose meals at one tap on their APP, highly recommended, excellent checkin, inflight service and meals. Our baggage even came out at the same time, all 9 suitcases. Made a longhaul flight with 4 children enjoyable and stress free.",1
  Edinburgh to Istanbul. The crew were amazing and a great dinner on this flight. IFE was working but PAX not offered headsets to watch or listen too which was odd. ,1
"  Miami to Doha return. Awesome from the lounge to the aircraft. Onboard the staff was very professional and courteous, I was totally impressed. I am looking forward to another trip with this airline.",1
"  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai . I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again. However, it is very handy from Newcastle upon Tyne to get a bit further afield, come on Emirates, get your act together! One positive is the IFE, very good.",0
"  Really enjoyed this short flight from London to Paris CDG! The aircraft was looking new, flight departed on time, friendly cabin crews and nice Pain au Chocolat for breakfast was served for this 45 mins flight. Looking forward to fly with Air France in the future.",1
 The crew was so friendly and nice. The food was amazing and the seat was comfortable. I loved their Bibimbap and their side dishes. My favorite part of the seat was how much privacy you had,1
  Bangkok to Aberdeen via Paris. I am pleasantly surprised to say that Air France have appeared to have upped their game. All the flight attendants was very pleasant and even in CDG the staff was smiling which is a significant difference from previous adventures. Whatever has happened keep it up AF. I had a great journey today.,1
  Philadelphia to Hyderabad  via Doha. I am a 70+ old lady with walking disability and was travelling alone from USA to India. Qatar Airways service was excellent and stayed at the airport during my break of journey. The service was excellent and a model for other airport hotels and airlines. This service is a great business model for old people travelling between India and USA. Special Thanks to Qatar Airways staff of QR 728 for calming me down and professionally accommodating me and understanding our situation. Kudos to the whole team for such an excellent performance.,1
"  It was the worst experience that I ever had. I bought 3 tickets for myself, my wife and my 19 month old son since we need extra room when we are flying. We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey. We would try to avoid this airline and country in overall for upcoming vacations. ",0
"  Turkish Airlines customer service in Mogadishu is horrible. My flight at Mogadishu, Somalia was scheduled to leave at 10:45am. I was at the departure check in by 9:30am, but they told me to get my covid 19 test certified by the Somali health ministry. At 9:45am when I came back to check in, they told me the gate was closed. I went to speak to the manager who refused to let me board the plan because according to him, ""the gate closes 1 hour and 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time."" Their top manager in Somalia can barely speak English, is extremely rude and unreasonable. I will choose another airline on my next visit to Somalia.",0
"  Cairo to Vienna via Istanbul. I consider Turkish Airlines one of the best airlines for everything, the aircraft cabin is clean and the crew polite and helpful. Even the transit area at Ataturk airport was an amazing experience and we had almost 5 to 6 hours transit time at the airport but we really enjoyed it.",1
"  München to Singapore. Great A350 aircraft, everything very clean, extra clean restrooms with some extras, Great Entertainment programme, good food and real forks, wet towels for refreshing while waiting on a meal. Very helpful and professional staff. Cool uniforms, big Choice of onboard shopping. The best airline I've flown.",1
"  Singapore to Tokyo. I chose this particular flight over others of the day to experience SQ new Boeing 787-10. However, it was later changed to an A380. Though this was an old version, the aircraft was well maintained and clean. Singapore Airlines lounge at SIN Terminal 3 was nice but crowded at the time. Boarding was in order, and cabin service was generally good.",1
"  Stockholm to Hi Chi Minh City via Doha. Privilege Gold membership not giving anything apart from lounge access, onboard staff not done anything special for me apart of that on last leg my preference meal was already given away so they give me food from business class. Previously you been able to get free upgrades at gate if you're gold member but not anymore. Qmiles redemption worth half of the value then was before May 2018. ",0
"  Istanbul to London. This airline is running a baggage scam. Be very aware. On their website they claim to allow free 2 bags (check in up to 32 kilos each) . When you arrive at counter , they don't speak English and keep telling you are not allowed any bags and must pay for it. They leave you with no option. I had to pay $400 dollars for my two bags , weighing 20 mg each. Avoid this airline like the plague. They do not speak English and are scamming people with this whole luggage scam. It's basically some sort of legalized robbery.",0
"  There was nothing special at Frankfurt airport pre-departure. It was good when we got onboard. The seat on SQ 777-300ER is similar to that on the A350-900ULR, meaning it is spacious and comfortable. Catering from Frankfurt was excellent, and I liked all the dishes served, especially the satay (I heard the satay was brought from Singapore, but I was not sure). Cabin crew were very nice and helpful, as expected from SQ.",1
"  My experience today with ANA on flight NH211 from Haneda to London was far from satisfactory, marking it as my worst business class experience to date. The first setback was a 90-minute wait for business class check-in, an unprecedented delay. The staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized, leaving counters unmanned for long periods. The frustration grew when informed that my luggage wouldn't arrive with me but on a subsequent flight, with no clear indication of its arrival time. Adding to the disappointment was the last-minute aircraft change. I had chosen this flight specifically for ANA's acclaimed 'The Room' business class service, but it was changed to the old business class on a 777, with no prior notice. The older business class configuration was a stark contrast to the modern luxury I anticipated. The seating arrangements added to the chaos. All pre-arranged seat allocations were discarded, forcing passengers, including myself, to travel in separate seats. The Wi-Fi on this flight was painfully slow and frustratingly unreliable, It's a stark contrast to the high standards typically associated with Japanese airlines. This series of missteps has left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing any positive aspects of the journey. It's a reminder that even reputable airlines can falter, and in this instance, ANA has unfortunately fallen short of the mark.",0
"  Mumbai to Sydney via Singapore. I was travelling with my father in law and he was travelling outside India for the first time. I had requested for wheel chair assistance, but was hesitant about the extent of assistance provided and feasible. I was so pleasantly surprised to see that all my worries  were reduced to nothing with the extent of co-operation, understanding and courteousness displayed by the staff. Hereon, I will be suggesting Singapore Airlines to everybody who asks me. A big thank you to the flight crew and ground staff for SQ 423 and SQ211 on 18th and 19th of May. Keep up the good work guys.",1
"  Doha to Ahmedabad. Considering it was a three hour flight, it was quite comfortable. Seats were comfortable for a short haul. Food was as good as what I got on longer haul. Luggage arrived safely and quickly except for one broken lock. ",1
"  . The story is quite complicated and it involves Air France and Lufthansa. On route FCO-EWR via MUC, Lufthansa cancelled flight to EWR, so rebooked me to JFK via CDG. At CDG I boarded an AF flight. My baggage was lost and did not arrive in JFK with me. AF baggage service told me to call on the phone if with no informations within 24 hours. So I did. A man answered he could not help and asked to call back in 10 minutes. After that moment no one ever answered me from AF baggage service for two days. When finally I could speak to someone, again I was told to call later. I shouted that I could not call again to get no answer; the lady in the phone offered to help but with no results. Again she asked me to call again; I said that I could not spend all my time in waiting on the phone for nobody. She promised me to call me back, but nobody called. Finally my baggage arrived at the sixth day, being informed of the delivery only two hours before. I contacted AF via twitter on 14th August and via Facebook on the same day. They answered me only on 24th August. The worst customer care ever!",0
"  New York JFK check in a disaster, with no control, and only 2 agents open. For an extremely protracted amount of time, I stood in line, and finally got checked in, just before the Station Manager mustered everyone, for the evening brief, pausing check in. Boarding commenced 15 minutes late.  No boarding by rows, just a mass exodus. Upon boarding the Cabin Attendant at the door, was the sole person to welcome me onboard. IFE finally got upgraded, and the A380s fixed shellback seat was extremely comfortable. Upon taking off I dozed off, and was waken up by Cabin Crew to close my window shade. No initial drink offered to me. I requested Chicken for dinner, and the Gentleman said he had to come back. 15 minutes later, I hit the call button, and when the young lady I arrived, I explained to her I did not receive dinner. Finally the Gentleman returned, apologized, and ensured dinner would be out shortly, which it was. Followed by a second round of drinks. Woke up to a refreshment, of extremely small Sandwich of sorts, and a quick round of drinks. Arrived at FRA, and off to my connection. With all my hours, flights, and years flying with Singapore Airlines I will try to brush this off, and hope a repeat of this experience will not happen again.",1
"  Doha to Dallas, a 14 hour flight, but I am not feeling tired. I can enjoy my flight with delicious food, wide legroom, good entertainment and good service from cabin crew.",1
"  Turkish Airlines is the worst ever airline, with horrible customer service! Never fly by this company! We had a flight from Dubai to Miami with connection in Istanbul. They denied us boarding because of ticket not in sequence. Managers at airport was not helpful and assisting, they were very rude and disrespectful. He said If you can show me boarding pass or any proof of flying from Istanbul to Dubai then you can board the flight -  that was like 15 days ago. After unpleasant talk with useless and unhelpful management we went to ticket office, it’s 30 min drive from airport. They said we are sorry it’s in error on our side in the system, we will reissue tickets for tomorrow, but we can’t provide any assistance with transportation, accommodation and meals. So not only we have to do run around with our luggage and with my mom in age and we need to pay for there mistakes.",0
" All flights were cancelled at Terminal 1, NAIA due to technical problems. All passengers of Eva Air BR278 were waiting in line For about an hour and there was no one at the check in counter to explain what we do next, and only a piece of paper showing contact numbers were given to us to rebook. My first time to fly Eva Air because my husband had very good things to say about the airline. The flight was to depart to Taipei at 1850 and I have a connecting flight to LAX at 2355. There was no one at the Check in counter and the Office was closed at 5pm. Text Message to my Phone about flight cancellation was received at 4:31pm and paper with contact information was passed around at around 4:45pm. ",0
"  Munich to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore. I will never fly with this airline again. My wife and I booked two seats from Madrid to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. We had a big drama at the airport in Munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from Vietnam. We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasn't our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didn't even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry? On arrival to Vietnam, we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged. The airline did replace them however we had to go through the drama of filling out forms/taking photos at the airport after a very long flight. ",0
  Air France is providing zero service in Business Class on flights between the UK and France. I flew Manchester to Paris and was offered nothing. Not even water. The crew disappeared to the back of the aircraft and closed the curtain for the entire flight. When I asked the Purser working the flight why there was no inflight service he advised AF had taken the decision to scrap all service throughout the aircraft on UK-France flights 'due to COVID'. What a joke.,0
" Chicago to Sarajevo via Istanbul. The customer service is beyond horrible. Changing the date of the flight due to father’s unexpected passing was a nightmare. The fee to change the flight was over $1,000. A new ticket would have been $1,400. I had to speak to several different agents. Only one expressed her condolences. The rest sounded like robots who barely spoke English and complained that there was nothing they could do. Twice the line was disconnected and I had to start all over with the new agent.",0
  New York to Bangkok via Taipei. Amazing! Great service and food. Staff was friendly and attentive. Beds were comfortable. Bathroom were clean. I would definitely use this airline again.,1
"  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldn’t care less.",0
"  I have been flying for last 20 years - never had such bad customer service experience. The representatives at Istanbul are rude, mis-informed and have no clue of the process. My Kuwait flight from Delhi was delayed that led to change in the complete itinerary. Since complete journey was booked through Turkish, I was hoping to get some help from Turkish Airlines. The staff refused to acknowledge that my situation was due to delayed flight. Instead of helping me, they started questioning me on why I did not take another flight from Kuwait to Istanbul. The lady at customer service refused to listen and was referring to mail sent few weeks back - which mentioned about 5 minutes change in schedule. I tried to reason that situation was due to delayed flight that no one would know 3 weeks ahead, but she refused to listen. Another representative questioned me on why I did not take other flight from Kuwait - even after explaining that it was Turkish ticket and we took 1st flight that was offered. There was no Turkish desk at Kuwait. Communication is another big issue. The attitude of representatives were to push customers to any direction without giving them proper information. Worst ever experience!",0
"  After some pretty poor experiences this year using my preferred airline Singapore Airlines, I decided to try Qatar again after 6 years. Check in at Heathrow T4 quick and polite as was the boarding process. On board I found the A380 upper deck very good for economy, service from the crew was very good as was the food. Transfer in Doha quick and easy boarding for KUL done well and again seating felt roomy and comfortable even with the 3-4-3 seating on the 777, arrived KL a little early good flights. Returning check in polite unfortunately KLIA is a dreadful airport, possibly the worst in Asia with poor and uninterested staff along with poor facilities. That apart despite a 2 hour delay the flight to Doha was again pretty good, quick transfer in Doha all fine and the final flight to London was very nice. Bags recovered quickly, I will be using Qatar Airways in future.",1
"  Have now flown with Qatar Airways on several occasions, with positive experiences every time. They are efficient, friendly, helpful and always looking after the customer needs. Great service, people, food, facilities and customer care. Unreservedly recommended.",1
"  I would like to give special praise for Air Stewardess Nurul who served me at the Premium Economy cabin. She has been very proactive in asking and suggesting drinks and snacks to eat throughout the trip. Very friendly , good listener and very conversant. ",1
  Beijing to Hong Kong. A good flight. Slight delay but this is normal for this route. Service is adequate but nothing special. There is hot meal served. The cabin is the old type business (non-flat out) but good enough for short haul. No greeting to members (may be I am only Sapphire and not good enough). Cathay Pacific service is declining.,1
"  I had to go to Doha for business and of course I chose Qatar Airways, and it was such a great experience. First of all, when I arrived to the Qatar Airways point to get my ticket staff were nice and helpful answering all my doubts. Then onboard the airplane the cabin crew were nice offering different snacks and beverages. I used the inflight entertainment offered and the flight went by quickly. The only thing I think they could improve was the wifi, I never got connected.",1
"  Other than horrible seating for anyone with the slightest back problems or other problems which I might not be familiar with, the food is definitely not for most people’s taste. I’m not even going to elaborate on customer service. My luggage didn’t make it to the flight. Why? Answer: “you only had 1 hr and 15 mins before flights. This was my first time flying with Air France. I have another trip planned, which I hope to cancel. My delayed luggage was supposed to arrive 2 days later than my initial flight. (15th of August) it’s now 17th of August and no trace of baggage. I called and emailed several times. This morning I’ve been told there’s a car dropping off my suitcase at 1-2 pm. No action has been taken. They’ve stopped answering my calls and emails. It’s the time of a global pandemic and us, travelers, have to quarantine. I was left in a cold room. You guessed it, not a hotel; not any other place I’m familiar with. I have nothing. I don’t have my medicine, warm clothes, a blanket, the necessities. I can’t go out to buy stuff anymore. I filed a compensation form, too. They replied, asking for flight details and pictures, which I provided. It is now days later and I still don’t have answers. Phone lines not picking up. Horrible customer service. The worst experience ever and I’m not a stranger to flying different distances.",0
" The flights that I booked for my daughter and fiancé were great, they got to the UK fine. Two days later they cancelled the flight from Hong Kong to Sydney. No explanation no alternative just cancelled, but not the flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong. So they get to Hong Kong and are left there. No communication, no assistance, just left. I have now paid for their return on a reliable airline. Do not trust Cathay Pacific.",0
  After missing my flight they showed no interest in helping me book a new flight. As my confusion grew with the booking prices and unanswered questions they waved me away. The inflight staff was also forgetful and rushed service even though it was an 11hr flight. Overall extremely dissatisfied.,0
"  The flight from ATL to IST was good; however the food was not as good as it used to be, the number of options and quality has declined tremendously. Boarding at IST to DXB was a concern for us, too many people on an enclosed waiting room and delayed flight. The Boeing 777-300 interior looks tired. The onboard service was very simple to poor. The seats were ample but tired. It still has three seats in the middle, configuration 2-3-2, which is not the most desirable, unless you are flying in a family of three. Disembarkation in Dubai was disorderly, instead of doing it by rows, the passengers in Economy just pushed their way through Business to get out first, no social distancing or order by put in place by crew.",0
 Washington DC to Chennai via Doha. Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines I have flown. Their service is impressive and food is great. Great customer service (except one ground ticketing staff in Washington Dulles airport). Their inflight entertainment is the best with a lot of options and languages. I highly recommend this airline for long haul flights.,1
  Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. My wife and I flew Singapore Air for first time and were very impressed. Economy seats the best we’ve had (and we travel a lot). Food and beverage service good and cabin crew were very efficient. Very good selection for inflight entertainment system. Highly recommended.,1
"  Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha. I used to fly British Airways 3 or 4 times a year between Muscat and Edinburgh but considering the visible decline in both aircraft quality and service now being offered by BA I decided to try Qatar Airways. The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline.",1
"  Flight to Doha was good. Qatar ground crew sent a message to arrive at the airport 4 hours before departure because of possible delays due construction. We arrived at the airport as instructed but there were no one at the check in counters. The counters were opened 3 hours before departure as usual. When I asked the Qatar agent on why we had to arrive 4 hours before departure, she didn’t know why and she opened the counters 3 hours before departure as scheduled. We requested for a wheel chair for 1 passenger when we booked the tickets, but we had to go back to the agent to order a wheelchair. We waited at a designated spot but no one came. We went through security to the lounge where they promptly got us a wheelchair to get to the gate. ",1
" Since most of the extra Covid precautions lifted of in terms of in-flight catering, this flight was at good quality. Welcome drinks that Turkish offers still not served due to Covid however, food was quite good. Crew served a mezze platter, accompanied by a main dish with three options as usual. Also crew were highly sensitive about wearing masks and constantly warning the ones who was taking of their masks unless they are eating or drinking. Hospitality of Turkish crew was as good as always.",1
"  Washington to Delhi through Dubai. Everything looked fine until I reached Dubai Airport before gate. My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.  Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the additional charge. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to check in my luggage and didn't allow in the flight.",0
"  Edinburgh to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent service, which I have now come to expect from Qatar. They outshine in almost every aspect. One gripe however, is the check in at Edinburgh, which may be managed by One World. This was seriously bad. It took 30 minutes to check in, with 2 passengers in front of me. The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation. We were then informed that there was no Fast Track (FT) for security clearance, but when we pointed out to the gate keeper that we were members of OneWorld, they allowed us to proceed through FT. Not sure why Qatar is not listed as a user of FT for its Business Class travellers. Onboard service was impeccable, with professional, efficient and pleasant staff, which is truly noteworthy. Wifi connectivity did not appear to work on the several times I attempted to use it.",1
